In your career, you'll may suddenly get the opportunity to lead teams: to become a manager. But this is often uncharted territory. How can you decide whether this career move is right for you? And if you do, what do you need to learn to succeed? Where do you start? How do you know that you're doing it right? What does \"it\" even mean? And isn't management a dirty word? This book will share the secrets you need to know to manage engineers successfully. Going from engineer to manager doesn't have to be intimidating. Engineers can be managers, and fantastic ones at that. Cast aside the rhetoric and focus on practical, hands-on techniques and tools. You'll become an effective and supportive team leader that your staff will look up to. Start with your transition to being a manager and see how that compares to being an engineer. Learn how to better organize information, feel productive, and delegate, but not micromanage. Discover how to manage your own boss, hire and fire, do performance and salary reviews, and build a great team. You'll also learn the psychology: how to ship while keeping staff happy, coach and mentor, deal with deadline pressure, handle sensitive information, and navigate workplace politics. Consider your whole department. How can you work with other teams to ensure best practice? How do you help form guilds and committees and communicate effectively? How can you create career tracks for individual contributors and managers? How can you support flexible and remote working? How can you improve diversity in the industry through your own actions? This book will show you how. Great managers can make the world a better place. Join us.",

This updated report presents several common architecture styles to guide designers and developers on how to design components and to help you determine the ways in which those components should interact. Author Mark Richards takes a deep dive into many common software architecture styles. Each chapter includes a full explanation of how a particular style works, outlines its benefits and considerations, and describes the circumstances and conditions the style was designed to address. This report also presents an analysis of and scorecard for each style based on several architecture and software development quality attributes. Architecture styles include: Layered architecture Microkernel architecture Event-driven architecture Microservices architecture Space-based architecture This second edition includes new techniques and advances that have appeared for each architecture style over the past seven years. Guidelines in each chapter also reveal when--and when not--to use the style described. This edition introduces new topics such as the difference between architecture patterns and styles, monolithic versus distributed architectures, and technical versus domain partitioning. About the author: Mark Richards is a software architect with significant experience and expertise in application, integration, and enterprise architecture. Active in the software industry since 1983, he's the author of several O'Reilly books and videos, including Software Architecture: The Hard Parts, Software Architecture Fundamentals, Enterprise Messaging, Java Message Service, second edition, and 97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know.",

This book will uncover the secrets of what it means to be a successful director of engineering, VP of engineering, or CTO. With a hands-on, practical approach, it will help you understand and develop the skills that you need, ranging from how to manage other managers, to how to define and execute strategy, how to manage yourself and your limited time, and how to navigate your own career journey to your desired destination. You can become a great engineering leader, the kind that runs a healthy, ambitious, and efficient organization that builds quality products, and this practical guide will provide you with the skills to get there. With this book you'll uncover the tools, techniques, and secrets to being a successful and effective engineering executive. Starting with the roles and responsibilities of directors, VPs, and CTOs, explore their positions in the org chart and understand how they engage on tactical, operational, and strategic levels to deliver great products at scale. Dive into the tools and techniques that you need to be successful. Understand how to frame and allocate your time, how to play finite and infinite games, how to position and manage senior individual contributors, and how to get the best from your peers, your manager, and your counterparts that you collaborate with in other disciplines. Understand how to communicate at scale and then raise the bar through effective performance management. Get strategic: define, create, and execute your vision for your organization that stands the test of time. Understand the typical monthly, quarterly, and yearly cycles that companies go through and how to use them to your advantage. Tackle planning and budgets and understand how to make both work for you. Navigate wartime and peacetime successfully by adapting your priorities and leadership style. Plan out your career journey by understanding that it's never, ever a straight line to get to where you want to go. It's time for us to lift the lid on effective senior leadership. What You Need: There are no prerequisites for this book. However, it is aimed at engineering managers, so some experience or interest in management is useful.",

Overused and under-defined, the term is often used interchangeably with other strategic management terms. This textbook delineates and defines strategic thinking as an advanced, conceptual cognitive capability, focusing on the nonlinear, divergent, a-rational, and informal nature of strategic thinking. This unique and practical book is an original primer of how successful strategists learn to think strategically.\n\nIn this fourth edition, the author offers an expanded definition of strategic thinking based on critical theory. This book highlights the role of informal learning, underscores the relevance of engaging in the arts, and has global application for those tasked with making strategy in this rapidly changing world. Sloan presents a previously unexamined account of the relationship between strategic thinking and the learning process involved-taking learning from the academic to the everyday.

        "description": "This course provides an extensive exploration of C++. The journey starts with mastering the syntax and functionalities of C++ such as variables, loops, and functions, and progresses through more complex concepts like object-oriented programming, where you'll explore classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. Special attention is given to the nuances of pointers, memory management, and constructors for robust application development. As the course unfolds, you'll delve into advanced C++11/14/17 features, including move semantics, lambda expressions, and smart pointers, which are essential for modern C++ developers looking to enhance performance and manageability of their code. Exception handling and file I/O operations ensure that you can handle data and errors gracefully. Further sections focus on the STL, where you will learn to utilize powerful library functions and containers that can dramatically simplify data handling and processing tasks. We will also cover C++ concurrency, teaching you to write multithreaded software that is both efficient and safe. You'll also explore C++17's new features which simplify code and improve performance, along with detailed discussions on template programming. By the end of this course, you will have a solid understanding of C++'s capabilities and how to apply them to solve real-world problems. To access the supplementary materials, scroll down to the 'Resources' section above the 'Course Outline' and click 'Supplemental Content.' This will either initiate a download or redirect you to GitHub. What you will learn Apply Modern C++ (C++11/14/17) in programs Use STL components in your applications Write real-world applications in C++ Dynamically allocate memory to your C++ program Construct classes and objects Implement the functions you have learned in your project Audience If you are a college student who wants to learn modern C++ or an expert C++ developer who wants to migrate to modern C++, this course is for you. It will also help C++ developers with varying levels of experience to refresh their knowledge of C++ basics and get acquainted with the new features. Anyone comfortable with languages such as C, Java, C#, and Python will find this course useful in order to learn and apply modern C++.

These renowned leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators have tested their visions and assumptions and have forged revolutionary business models. In this book, they share their most important insights, learnings, and tools. They cover broad topics such as entrepreneurship, innovation, and leadership, and they illustrate why these are not separate topics, but indeed must be combined and linked to succeed as a business and as an entrepreneur. The GuruBook was published in Scandinavia in the Autumn of 2016 and was an instant #1 bestseller. This English version of the book contains many additional exciting interviews with thinkers such as Salim Ismail (Singularity University), Naveen Jain (Moon Express), Jimmy Maymann (Huffington Post), Otto Scharmer (Theory U), Blake Mycoskie (TOMS) and many others. The GuruBook is for burgeoning entrepreneurs, leaders, business developers, and innovators who know that traditional business models no longer provide results in fast-evolving digital and global economies. Other contributing authors to the book include Simon Sinek, Seth Godin, Steve Blank, Sonia Arrison, Daniel Burrus, Edgar H.

With over 250 problems and solutions, you'll learn new ways to deal with real-world coding tasks and answers to common interview questions. Purchase of the print or Kindle book includes a free PDF eBook Key Features Solve Java programming challenges and get interview-ready with the power of modern Java 21 Test your Java skills using language features, algorithms, data structures, and design patterns Explore tons of examples, all fully refreshed for this edition, meant to help you accommodate JDK 12 to JDK 21 Book Description The super-fast evolution of the JDK between versions 12 and 21 has made the learning curve of modern Java steeper, and increased the time needed to learn it. This book will make your learning journey quicker and increase your willingness to try Java’s new features by explaining the correct practices and decisions related to complexity, performance, readability, and more. Java Coding Problems takes you through Java’s latest features but doesn’t always advocate the use of new solutions — instead, it focuses on revealing the trade-offs involved in deciding what the best solution is for a certain problem. There are more than two hundred brand new and carefully selected problems in this second edition, chosen to highlight and cover the core everyday challenges of a Java programmer. Apart from providing a comprehensive compendium of problem solutions based on real-world examples, this book will also give you the confidence to answer questions relating to matching particular streams and methods to various problems. By the end of this book you will have gained a strong understanding of Java’s new features and have the confidence to develop and choose the right solutions to your problems. What you will learn Adopt the latest JDK 21 features in your applications Explore Records, Record Patterns, Record serialization and so on Work with Sealed Classes and Interfaces for increasing encapsulation Learn how to exploit Context-Specific Deserialization Filters Solve problems relating to collections and esoteric data structures Learn advanced techniques for extending the Java functional API Explore the brand-new Socket API and Simple Web Server Tackle modern Garbage Collectors and Dynamic CDS Archives Who this book is for If you are a Java developer who wants to level-up by solving real-world problems, then this book is for you.

This book offers a targeted approach to address the unique memory constraints of each domain. Written by an ISO C++ Standards Committee member, Patrice Roy, this guide covers fundamental concepts of object lifetime and memory organization to help you write simpler and safer programs. You’ll learn how to control memory allocation mechanisms, create custom containers and allocators, and adapt allocation operators to suit your specific requirements, making your programs smaller, faster, safer, and more predictable. Starting with core principles of memory management, this book introduces modern facilities that simplify your work and then dives into memory management mechanics, building solutions for specific application needs, and measuring their impact on your program’s behavior. By the end of this book, you’ll be able to write secure programs that handle memory optimally for your application domain. You will also have a strong grasp of both high-level abstractions for safer programs and low-level abstractions that allow detailed customization. What you will learn Master the C++ object model to write more efficient and maintainable code Automate resource management to reduce manual errors and improve safety Customize memory allocation operators to optimize performance for specific applications Develop your own smart pointers to manage dynamic memory with greater control Adapt allocation behavior to meet the unique needs of different data types Create safe and fast containers to ensure optimal data handling in your programs Utilize standard allocators to streamline memory management in your containers Who this book is for This book is for programmers who find C++ memory management challenging yet want to master it. It’s ideal for those seeking greater control over memory allocation to make their programs smaller, faster, and safer. Whether you're a seasoned C++ developer or transitioning from other languages, you'll gain insights into how C++ can enhance your programming. It’s especially valuable if you’re working in constrained environments, like embedded systems or game development. Prior experience with programming concepts, such as generic and concurrent programming, is helpful.",

They treat it as a craft. They are professionals. In The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers, legendary software expert Robert C. Martin introduces the disciplines, techniques, tools, and practices of true software craftsmanship. This book is packed with practical advice–about everything from estimating and coding to refactoring and testing. It covers much more than technique: It is about attitude. Martin shows how to approach software development with honor, self-respect, and pride; work well and work clean; communicate and estimate faithfully; face difficult decisions with clarity and honesty; and understand that deep knowledge comes with a responsibility to act. Readers will learn What it means to behave as a true software craftsman How to deal with conflict, tight schedules, and unreasonable managers How to get into the flow of coding, and get past writer’s block How to handle unrelenting pressure and avoid burnout How to combine enduring attitudes with new development paradigms How to manage your time, and avoid blind alleys, marshes, bogs, and swamps How to foster environments where programmers and teams can thrive When to say “No”–and how to say it When to say “Yes”–and what yes really means Great software is something to marvel at: powerful, elegant, functional, a pleasure to work with as both a developer and as a user. Great software isn’t written by machines. It is written by professionals with an unshakable commitment to craftsmanship. The Clean Coder will help you become one of them–and earn the pride and fulfillment that they alone possess.",

        "description": "This course begins with an introduction to the core concepts of Large Language Models and the LangChain framework. You'll start with the basics of forming prompts and setting up your environment, followed by a code demonstration to solidify your understanding. The first section wraps up with a quiz to test your newfound knowledge. Moving forward, we delve into the fundamental concepts of LangChain. You'll learn about prompt templates, chat prompt templates, and the intricacies of working with agents and tools. As you progress, the course covers advanced topics such as document loaders, output parsers, language embeddings, and vector databases. Practical applications, like creating your first RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) application, are integrated to enhance your learning experience. The final section focuses on real-world RAG applications and projects. You'll work on diverse projects, including SQL data integration, conversational memory, CV search applications, and website query chatbots. By the end of the course, you'll be proficient in analyzing structured data using natural language and creating sophisticated AI-driven applications, ready to apply these skills in real-world scenarios.

As a database server, it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applications. This book starts by describing the inner workings of the query optimizer, and will enable you to use this knowledge to write better queries and provide the query engine with all the information it needs to produce efficient execution plans. As you progress, you'll get practical query optimization tips for troubleshooting underperforming queries. The book will also guide you through intelligent query processing and what is new in SQL Server 2022. Query performance topics such as the Query Store, In-Memory OLTP and columnstore indexes are covered as well. By the end of this book, you'll be able to get the best possible performance for your queries and applications. What you will learn Troubleshoot queries using methods including extended events, SQL Trace, and dynamic management views Understand how the execution engine and query operators work Speed up queries and improve app performance by creating the right indexes Detect and fix cardinality estimation errors by examining query optimizer statistics Monitor and promote both plan caching and plan reuse to improve app performance Troubleshoot and improve query performance by using the Query Store Improve the performance of data warehouse queries by using columnstore indexes Handle query processor limitations with hints and other methods Who this book is for This book is for SQL Server developers who are struggling with slow query execution, database administrators who are tasked with troubleshooting slow application performance, and database architects who design SQL Server databases in support of line-of-business and data warehousing applications.",

        "description": "Winner of the 2011 Jolt Excellence Award! Getting software released to users is often a painful, risky, and time-consuming process. This groundbreaking new book sets out the principles and technical practices that enable rapid, incremental delivery of high quality, valuable new functionality to users. Through automation of the build, deployment, and testing process, and improved collaboration between developers, testers, and operations, delivery teams can get changes released in a matter of hours—sometimes even minutes–no matter what the size of a project or the complexity of its code base. Jez Humble and David Farley begin by presenting the foundations of a rapid, reliable, low-risk delivery process. Next, they introduce the “deployment pipeline,” an automated process for managing all changes, from check-in to release. Finally, they discuss the “ecosystem” needed to support continuous delivery, from infrastructure, data and configuration management to governance. The authors introduce state-of-the-art techniques, including automated infrastructure management and data migration, and the use of virtualization. For each, they review key issues, identify best practices, and demonstrate how to mitigate risks. Coverage includes • Automating all facets of building, integrating, testing, and deploying software • Implementing deployment pipelines at team and organizational levels • Improving collaboration between developers, testers, and operations • Developing features incrementally on large and distributed teams • Implementing an effective configuration management strategy • Automating acceptance testing, from analysis to implementation • Testing capacity and other non-functional requirements • Implementing continuous deployment and zero-downtime releases • Managing infrastructure, data, components and dependencies • Navigating risk management, compliance, and auditing Whether you’re a developer, systems administrator, tester, or manager, this book will help your organization move from idea to release faster than ever—so you can deliver value to your business rapidly and reliably.",

        "description": "This beginner-friendly course offers a structured and immersive path to mastering Java from the ground up. It begins with setting up Java across Windows, macOS, and Linux, then transitions to hands-on coding using JShell. Learners tackle real-world challenges like building multiplication tables to understand Java expressions, variables, and console output. With over 300 lessons, the course deeply explores loops, conditionals, methods, and object-oriented principles including classes, encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction, and polymorphism. As learners gain confidence, they move to Eclipse IDE to build structured Java projects. Core programming skills are reinforced through interactive exercises, puzzles, debug tips, and review checkpoints. The course covers primitive and reference types, arrays, ArrayLists, wrapper classes, exception handling, file operations, multi-threading, and concurrency tools. Advanced modules include Java Collections, Generics, Functional Programming with streams, lambda expressions, and method references. The course also explores modern Java features from versions 10 through 24, and introduces Spring Framework, Spring Boot, JPA, and REST API development. Extensive interview prep guides and real-world scenarios ensure learners are job-ready and confident in using Java professionally. To access the supplementary materials, scroll down to the 'Resources' section above the 'Course Outline' and click 'Supplemental Content.' This will either initiate a download or redirect you to GitHub. What you will learn Install and configure Java and Eclipse across platforms Write Java code using JShell and Eclipse Apply core programming constructs: loops, conditionals, variables Develop Java classes and methods effectively Understand and implement OOP principles Work with collections, generics, and functional programming Audience This course is ideal for beginners with no prior programming experience.

        "description": "Explore the world of Java web services as you learn to build, deploy, and secure APIs using Spring Boot. Starting with core concepts and the differences between SOAP and REST, you'll move through hands-on tutorials covering Spring Framework and Spring Boot, gradually building your skills with real coding exercises and scalable apps. Advance by mastering SOAP services with a contract-first approach, working with WSDL, JAXB, and endpoint setup. Simultaneously, develop REST APIs for a social media-style app, adding features like CRUD, validation, error handling, content negotiation, and versioning. You'll also work with HATEOAS, Swagger, Spring Security, and Actuator for real-world readiness. Finally, integrate databases with JPA, mapping entities and relationships, and exploring Spring Data JPA and Hibernate. You'll also gain experience with Maven, Gradle, REST best practices, and functional programming in Java. Every step is designed to build practical skills and prepare you for professional backend development. To access the supplementary materials, scroll down to the 'Resources' section above the 'Course Outline' and click 'Supplemental Content.' This will either initiate a download or redirect you to GitHub. What you will learn Build RESTful and SOAP APIs using Spring Boot Integrate Java apps with databases using JPA and Hibernate Configure API security with Spring Security Document APIs using Swagger and OpenAPI Implement API versioning and error handling Automate builds with Maven and Gradle Audience This course is designed for Java developers with a basic understanding of object-oriented programming. No prior knowledge of Spring or web services is required, although familiarity with Java syntax is expected.

        "description": "Gain a solid practical understanding and sufficient theoretical insight into Linux kernel internals while learning to write high-quality kernel module code and understanding the complexities of kernel synchronization Purchase of the print or Kindle book includes a free eBook in PDF format. Key Features Discover how to write Linux kernel and module code for real-world products on the 6.1 LTS kernel Implement industry-grade techniques in real-world scenarios for fast, efficient memory allocation and data synchronization Understand and exploit kernel architecture, CPU scheduling, and kernel synchronization techniques Book Description The 2nd Edition of Linux Kernel Programming is an updated, comprehensive guide for those new to Linux kernel development. Built around the latest 6.1 Long-Term Support (LTS) Linux kernel, which is maintained until December 2026, this edition explores its key features and enhancements. Additionally, with the Civil Infrastructure Project extending support for the 6.1 Super LTS (SLTS) kernel until August 2033, this book will remain relevant for years to come. You'll begin this exciting journey by learning how to build the kernel from source. Step by step, you will then learn how to write your first kernel module by leveraging the kernel's powerful Loadable Kernel Module (LKM) framework. With this foundation, you will delve into key kernel internals topics including Linux kernel architecture, memory management, and CPU (task) scheduling. You'll finish with understanding the deep issues of concurrency, and gain insight into how they can be addressed with various synchronization/locking technologies (for example, mutexes, spinlocks, atomic/refcount operators, rw-spinlocks and even lock-free technologies such as per-CPU and RCU). By the end of this book, you'll build a strong understanding of the fundamentals to writing the Linux kernel and kernel module code that can straight away be used in real-world projects and products. What you will learn Configure and build the 6.1 LTS kernel from source Write high-quality modular kernel code (LKM framework) for 6.x kernels Explore modern Linux kernel architecture Get to grips with key internals details regarding memory management within the kernel Understand and work with various dynamic kernel memory alloc/dealloc APIs Discover key internals aspects regarding CPU scheduling within the kernel, including cgroups v2 Gain a deeper understanding of kernel concurrency issues Learn how to work with key kernel synchronization primitives Who this book is for This book is for beginner Linux programmers and developers looking to get started with the Linux kernel, providing a knowledge base to understand required kernel internal topics and overcome frequent and common development issues. A basic understanding of Linux CLI and C programming is assumed.",

But what’s most important for leadership is principled consistency, because small things done well time and again without fail build trust and respect within a team. Using stories from his time at Netflix, Apple, and Slack, Michael Lopp presents a series of practices to help you build leadership skills. You’ll learn how to create teams that are highly productive, highly respected, and highly trusted. Lopp has been speaking and writing about this topic for over a decade. He maintains a Slack channel with nearly 12000 members. In this practical audio book, Lopp illustrates the leadership skills he learned from exceptional leaders at three dynamic companies: Act I: As a manager under James Barksdale at Netflix Act II: As a senior manager/director under Steve Jobs at Apple Act III: As an executive with Stewart Butterfield at Slack",

The Classic Text Annotated to Update Graham's Timeless Wisdom for Today's Market Conditions The greatest investment advisor of the twentieth century, Benjamin Graham taught and inspired people worldwide. Graham's philosophy of \"value investing\" -- which shields investors from substantial error and teaches them to develop long-term strategies -- has made The Intelligent Investor the stock market bible ever since its original publication in 1949. Over the years, market developments have proven the wisdom of Graham's strategies. While preserving the integrity of Graham's original text, this revised edition includes updated commentary by noted financial journalist Jason Zweig, whose perspective incorporates the realities of today's market, draws parallels between Graham's examples and today's financial headlines, and gives readers a more thorough understanding of how to apply Graham's principles. Vital and indispensable, this HarperBusiness Essentials edition of The Intelligent Investor is the most important book you will ever read on how to reach your financial goals.",
