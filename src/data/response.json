The book features hundreds of interesting and practical examples of well-written Go code that cover the whole language, its most important packages, and a wide range of applications. Each chapter has exercises to test your understanding and explore extensions and alternatives. Source code is freely available for download from http://gopl.io/ and may be conveniently fetched, built, and installed using the go get command.",

Now this same team provides the best explanation yet of these new features, and of concurrency in general. Concurrency is no longer a subject for advanced users only. Every Java developer should read this book.\"</p><p>--Martin Buchholz</p><p>JDK Concurrency Czar, Sun Microsystems</p><p>\"For the past 30 years, computer performance has been driven by Moore’s Law; from now on, it will be driven by Amdahl’s Law. Writing code that effectively exploits multiple processors can be very challenging. <em><strong>Java Concurrency in Practice</strong></em> provides you with the concepts and techniques needed to write safe and scalable Java programs for today’s--and tomorrow’s--systems.\"</p><p>--Doron Rajwan</p><p>Research Scientist, Intel Corp</p><p>\"This is the book you need if you’re writing--or designing, or debugging, or maintaining, or contemplating--multithreaded Java programs. If you’ve ever had to synchronize a method and you weren’t sure why, you owe it to yourself and your users to read this book, cover to cover.\"</p><p>--Ted Neward</p><p>Author of <em>Effective Enterprise Java</em></p><p>\"Brian addresses the fundamental issues and complexities of concurrency with uncommon clarity. This book is a must-read for anyone who uses threads and cares about performance.\"</p><p>--Kirk Pepperdine</p><p>CTO, <a href=\"http://JavaPerformanceTuning.com\">JavaPerformanceTuning.com</a></p><p>\"This book covers a very deep and subtle topic in a very clear and concise way, making it the perfect Java Concurrency reference manual. Each page is filled with the problems (and solutions!) that programmers struggle with every day. Effectively exploiting concurrency is becoming more and more important now that Moore’s Law is delivering more cores but not faster cores, and this book will show you how to do it.\"</p><p>--Dr. Cliff Click</p><p>Senior Software Engineer, Azul Systems</p><p>\"I have a strong interest in concurrency, and have probably written more thread deadlocks and made more synchronization mistakes than most programmers. Brian’s book is the most readable on the topic of threading and concurrency in Java, and deals with this difficult subject with a wonderful hands-on approach.

I found reading this book intellectually exciting, in part because it is an excellent introduction to Java’s concurrency API, but mostly because it captures in a thorough and accessible way expert knowledge on threading not easily found elsewhere.\"</p><p>--Bill Venners</p><p>Author of <em>Inside the Java Virtual Machine</em></p><p>Threads are a fundamental part of the Java platform. As multicore processors become the norm, using concurrency effectively becomes essential for building high-performance applications. Java SE 5 and 6 are a huge step forward for the development of concurrent applications, with improvements to the Java Virtual Machine to support high-performance, highly scalable concurrent classes and a rich set of new concurrency building blocks. In <em><strong>Java Concurrency in Practice</strong></em>, the creators of these new facilities explain not only how they work and how to use them, but also the motivation and design patterns behind them.</p><p>However, developing, testing, and debugging multithreaded programs can still be very difficult; it is all too easy to create concurrent programs that appear to work, but fail when it matters most: in production, under heavy load. <strong><em>Java Concurrency in Practice</em></strong> arms readers with both the theoretical underpinnings and concrete techniques for building reliable, scalable, maintainable concurrent applications.

Now this same team provides the best explanation yet of these new features, and of concurrency in general. Concurrency is no longer a subject for advanced users only. Every Java developer should read this book.\" --Martin Buchholz JDK Concurrency Czar, Sun Microsystems \"For the past 30 years, computer performance has been driven by Moore’s Law; from now on, it will be driven by Amdahl’s Law. Writing code that effectively exploits multiple processors can be very challenging. Java Concurrency in Practice provides you with the concepts and techniques needed to write safe and scalable Java programs for today’s--and tomorrow’s--systems.\" --Doron Rajwan Research Scientist, Intel Corp \"This is the book you need if you’re writing--or designing, or debugging, or maintaining, or contemplating--multithreaded Java programs. If you’ve ever had to synchronize a method and you weren’t sure why, you owe it to yourself and your users to read this book, cover to cover.\" --Ted Neward Author of Effective Enterprise Java \"Brian addresses the fundamental issues and complexities of concurrency with uncommon clarity. This book is a must-read for anyone who uses threads and cares about performance.\" --Kirk Pepperdine CTO, JavaPerformanceTuning.com \"This book covers a very deep and subtle topic in a very clear and concise way, making it the perfect Java Concurrency reference manual. Each page is filled with the problems (and solutions!) that programmers struggle with every day. Effectively exploiting concurrency is becoming more and more important now that Moore’s Law is delivering more cores but not faster cores, and this book will show you how to do it.\" --Dr. Cliff Click Senior Software Engineer, Azul Systems \"I have a strong interest in concurrency, and have probably written more thread deadlocks and made more synchronization mistakes than most programmers. Brian’s book is the most readable on the topic of threading and concurrency in Java, and deals with this difficult subject with a wonderful hands-on approach. This is a book I am recommending to all my readers of The Java Specialists’ Newsletter, because it is interesting, useful, and relevant to the problems facing Java developers today.\" --Dr. Heinz Kabutz The Java Specialists’ Newsletter \"I’ve focused a career on simplifying simple problems, but this book ambitiously and effectively works to simplify a complex but critical subject: concurrency. Java Concurrency in Practice is revolutionary in its approach, smooth and easy in style, and timely in its delivery--it’s destined to be a very important book.\" --Bruce Tate Author of Beyond Java \"Java Concurrency in Practice is an invaluable compilation of threading know-how for Java developers. I found reading this book intellectually exciting, in part because it is an excellent introduction to Java’s concurrency API, but mostly because it captures in a thorough and accessible way expert knowledge on threading not easily found elsewhere.\" --Bill Venners Author of Inside the Java Virtual Machine Threads are a fundamental part of the Java platform. As multicore processors become the norm, using concurrency effectively becomes essential for building high-performance applications. Java SE 5 and 6 are a huge step forward for the development of concurrent applications, with improvements to the Java Virtual Machine to support high-performance, highly scalable concurrent classes and a rich set of new concurrency building blocks. In Java Concurrency in Practice, the creators of these new facilities explain not only how they work and how to use them, but also the motivation and design patterns behind them. However, developing, testing, and debugging multithreaded programs can still be very difficult; it is all too easy to create concurrent programs that appear to work, but fail when it matters most: in production, under heavy load. Java Concurrency in Practice arms readers with both the theoretical underpinnings and concrete techniques for building reliable, scalable, maintainable concurrent applications. Rather than simply offering an inventory of concurrency APIs and mechanisms, it provides design rules, patterns, and mental models that make it easier to build concurrent programs that are both correct and performant. This book covers: Basic concepts of concurrency and thread safety Techniques for building and composing thread-safe classes Using the concurrency building blocks in java.util.concurrent Performance optimization dos and don’ts Testing concurrent programs Advanced topics such as atomic variables, nonblocking algorithms, and the Java Memory Model",

Updated topics include improving test quality via development mnemonics, increasing ROI through test and production code refactoring, and using tests to drive development.</p><p><i>Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java with JUnit</i> steps you through all the important unit testing topics.</p><p>If you've never written a unit test, you'll be hand-held through the hard part - getting set up and started. Once past the basics, you'll see numerous examples in order to start understanding what tests for common code concepts look like. You'll then learn how to effectively use the essential features of JUnit, the predominant tool for writing and executing unit tests in Java.</p><p>You'll gain the combined wisdom of Jeff Langr and original authors Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas, providing decades of unit testing experience on real production systems. You'll learn how to:</p><p>\n</p><ul><li>Craft your code to make unit testing easier in the first place</li><li>Craft your unit tests to minimize your maintenance effort</li><li>Use unit tests to support keeping your system clean through refactoring</li><li>Refactor toward a design that will create the highest possible ROI</li><li>Test the tough stuff, including code that must be mocked</li><li>Remember what's important when writing unit tests</li><li>Help your team reap and sustain the benefits of unit testing</li><li>Use AI tooling as part of a development process that incorporates unit testing</li></ul><p>You won't just learn about unit testing in theory - you'll learn about \"real\" unit testing the Pragmatic way, by working through numerous code examples.</p><p><b>What You Need:</b></p><p>You'll need the Java SDK (Software Development Kit) version 21 or higher to work through the examples in the book.

                "description": "The classic Pragmatic Unit Testing with Java in JUnit returns for a third edition, streamlined and rewritten with updated and more accessible code examples. In this edition, you'll learn how to create concise, maintainable unit tests with confidence. New chapters provide a foundation of examples for testing common concepts, and guidance on incorporating modern AI tools into your development and testing. Updated topics include improving test quality via development mnemonics, increasing ROI through test and production code refactoring, and using tests to drive development. Pragmatic Unit Testing in Java with JUnit steps you through all the important unit testing topics. If you've never written a unit test, you'll be hand-held through the hard part - getting set up and started. Once past the basics, you'll see numerous examples in order to start understanding what tests for common code concepts look like. You'll then learn how to effectively use the essential features of JUnit, the predominant tool for writing and executing unit tests in Java. You'll gain the combined wisdom of Jeff Langr and original authors Andy Hunt and Dave Thomas, providing decades of unit testing experience on real production systems. You'll learn how to: Craft your code to make unit testing easier in the first place Craft your unit tests to minimize your maintenance effort Use unit tests to support keeping your system clean through refactoring Refactor toward a design that will create the highest possible ROI Test the tough stuff, including code that must be mocked Remember what's important when writing unit tests Help your team reap and sustain the benefits of unit testing Use AI tooling as part of a development process that incorporates unit testing You won't just learn about unit testing in theory - you'll learn about \"real\" unit testing the Pragmatic way, by working through numerous code examples. What You Need: You'll need the Java SDK (Software Development Kit) version 21 or higher to work through the examples in the book. You'll also want an IDE (Integrated Development Environment) in which to build code. While most of the book doesn't assume use of any specific IDE, you'll find a number of \"getting started\" screen shots to help you if you're using IntelliJ IDEA.",

Concise, intuitive, and practical, it is based on years of road-testing in the authors' own parallel computing courses. Various techniques for constructing and optimizing parallel programs are explored in detail, while case studies demonstrate the development process, which begins with computational thinking and ends with effective and efficient parallel programs. The new edition includes updated coverage of CUDA, including the newer libraries such as CuDNN. New chapters on frequently used parallel patterns have been added, and case studies have been updated to reflect current industry practices. Parallel Patterns Introduces new chapters on frequently used parallel patterns (stencil, reduction, sorting) and major improvements to previous chapters (convolution, histogram, sparse matrices, graph traversal, deep learning) Ampere Includes a new chapter focused on GPU architecture and draws examples from recent architecture generations, including Ampere Systematic Approach Incorporates major improvements to abstract discussions of problem decomposition strategies and performance considerations, with a new optimization checklist",

This course begins with a solid foundation in Scala's syntax, exploring values, expressions, variables, and recursion. You'll get hands-on experience with the language structure while learning best practices for writing clean and maintainable code.</p><p>Moving forward, the course introduces object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and traits. You'll understand how Scala handles abstraction, exceptions, and generics, allowing you to write expressive, reusable code. In addition, functional programming techniques like higher-order functions, anonymous functions, and collections manipulation (map, flatMap, and filter) will reshape the way you think about programming.</p><p>By the end of this course, you'll have a solid grasp of Scala's powerful features, enabling you to write expressive, scalable, and maintainable code. Whether you're contributing to an existing Scala codebase, building your own applications, or engaging in open-source projects, this course will prepare you with the skills needed to navigate the Scala ecosystem confidently.</p><p>To access the supplementary materials, scroll down to the 'Resources' section above the 'Course Outline' and click 'Supplemental Content.'

                "description": "Scala is a modern programming language that combines functional and object-oriented paradigms, making it a preferred choice for scalable applications. This course begins with a solid foundation in Scala's syntax, exploring values, expressions, variables, and recursion. You'll get hands-on experience with the language structure while learning best practices for writing clean and maintainable code. Moving forward, the course introduces object-oriented programming concepts such as classes, inheritance, polymorphism, and traits. You'll understand how Scala handles abstraction, exceptions, and generics, allowing you to write expressive, reusable code. In addition, functional programming techniques like higher-order functions, anonymous functions, and collections manipulation (map, flatMap, and filter) will reshape the way you think about programming. By the end of this course, you'll have a solid grasp of Scala's powerful features, enabling you to write expressive, scalable, and maintainable code. Whether you're contributing to an existing Scala codebase, building your own applications, or engaging in open-source projects, this course will prepare you with the skills needed to navigate the Scala ecosystem confidently. To access the supplementary materials, scroll down to the 'Resources' section above the 'Course Outline' and click 'Supplemental Content.' This will either initiate a download or redirect you to GitHub. What you will learn Write concise and expressive Scala code Implement object-oriented principles in Scala Apply functional programming techniques effectively Manipulate collections using map, flatMap, and filter Handle exceptions and use generics for type safety Build scalable applications with Scala fundamentals Audience This course is designed for programmers with at least one year of experience in any programming language. Prior knowledge of Java, Python, TypeScript, or C is beneficial, as the course draws parallels to mainstream languages. If you are eager to master a language that blends functional and object-oriented programming while writing expressive, type-safe code, this course is for you.

Hands-On Software Architecture with Golang starts with a brief introduction to architectural elements, Go, and a case study to demonstrate architectural principles. You'll then move on to look at code-level aspects such as modularity, class design, and constructs specific to Golang and implementation of design patterns. As you make your way through the chapters, you'll explore the core objectives of architecture such as effectively managing complexity, scalability, and reliability of software systems. You'll also work through creating distributed systems and their communication before moving on to modeling and scaling of data. In the concluding chapters, you'll learn to deploy architectures and plan the migration of applications from other languages. By the end of this book, you will have gained insight into various design and architectural patterns, which will enable you to create robust, scalable architecture using Golang. What you will learn Understand architectural paradigms and deep dive into Microservices Design parallelism/concurrency patterns and learn object-oriented design patterns in Go Explore API-driven systems architecture with introduction to REST and GraphQL standards Build event-driven architectures and make your architectures anti-fragile Engineer scalability and learn how to migrate to Go from other languages Get to grips with deployment considerations with CICD pipeline, cloud deployments, and so on Build an end-to-end e-commerce (travel) application backend in Go Who this book is for Hands-On Software Architecture with Golang is for software developers, architects, and CTOs looking to use Go in their software architecture to build enterprise-grade applications.

This updated report presents several common architecture styles to guide designers and developers on how to design components and to help you determine the ways in which those components should interact. \n</p><p>\nAuthor Mark Richards takes a deep dive into many common software architecture styles. Each chapter includes a full explanation of how a particular style works, outlines its benefits and considerations, and describes the circumstances and conditions the style was designed to address. This report also presents an analysis of and scorecard for each style based on several architecture and software development quality attributes.\n</p><p><b>Architecture styles include:</b></p><ul><li>Layered architecture \n</li><li>Microkernel architecture \n</li><li>Event-driven architecture \n</li><li>Microservices architecture \n</li><li>Space-based architecture \n</li></ul><p>This second edition includes new techniques and advances that have appeared for each architecture style over the past seven years. Guidelines in each chapter also reveal when--and when not--to use the style described. This edition introduces new topics such as the difference between architecture patterns and styles, monolithic versus distributed architectures, and technical versus domain partitioning.\n</p><p><b>About the author:</b>\nMark Richards is a software architect with significant experience and expertise in application, integration, and enterprise architecture. Active in the software industry since 1983, he's the author of several O'Reilly books and videos, including <i>Software Architecture: The Hard Parts</i>, <i>Software Architecture Fundamentals</i>, <i>Enterprise Messaging</i>, <i>Java Message Service, second edition</i>, and <i>97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know</i>.</p></div></span>",

                "description": "The success of any software application or system depends on the architecture style you use. This updated report presents several common architecture styles to guide designers and developers on how to design components and to help you determine the ways in which those components should interact. Author Mark Richards takes a deep dive into many common software architecture styles. Each chapter includes a full explanation of how a particular style works, outlines its benefits and considerations, and describes the circumstances and conditions the style was designed to address. This report also presents an analysis of and scorecard for each style based on several architecture and software development quality attributes. Architecture styles include: Layered architecture Microkernel architecture Event-driven architecture Microservices architecture Space-based architecture This second edition includes new techniques and advances that have appeared for each architecture style over the past seven years. Guidelines in each chapter also reveal when--and when not--to use the style described. This edition introduces new topics such as the difference between architecture patterns and styles, monolithic versus distributed architectures, and technical versus domain partitioning. About the author: Mark Richards is a software architect with significant experience and expertise in application, integration, and enterprise architecture. Active in the software industry since 1983, he's the author of several O'Reilly books and videos, including Software Architecture: The Hard Parts, Software Architecture Fundamentals, Enterprise Messaging, Java Message Service, second edition, and 97 Things Every Software Architect Should Know.",

                "description": "htmx is a library that adds logic and server interaction to HTML; you get the effect of using a front-end SPA framework without writing front-end code. Use any server-side programming language and framework to build server applications with endpoints that simply return snippets of HTML. Dynamically update portions of the current web page from HTTP responses. Add interactivity with JavaScript and libraries such Alpine and _hyperscript. Make your apps more secure by escaping user-supplied content and specifying a Content Security Policy. Go beyond basic HTTP requests with WebSockets and server-sent events. The htmx JavaScript library gives you a new way to craft web applications. The htmx approach differs significantly from that of the currently popular single-page application (SPA) frameworks; rather than write a bunch of JavaScript, you simply annotate HTML elements before you send them to the browser. The resulting code is easier to understand and modify, and because it downloads less to the browser and doesn't need JSON creation and parsing, you'll find it performs better, too. Rethink web application design; write code in any language that simply responds to requests with htmx snippets. Dynamically update portions of the current web page directly from the server. Implement common patterns such as lazy loading, input validation, CSS transitions, active search, optimistic updates, pagination, infinite scroll, polling, and click-to-edit. Add interactivity with JavaScript and libraries such as Alpine and _hyperscript. Use the htmx JavaScript API to simplify DOM operations. Make your web apps more secure: escape user-supplied content, use Subresource Integrity hashes, and enforce a Content Security Policy. Go beyond the basic HTTP request/response pattern with WebSockets and server-sent events. Discover a simpler way to implement web applications that emphasizes web fundamentals. What You Need: A modern web browser and the ability to build and run a local HTTP server using the server-side language and framework of your choice. The code examples are fully compatible with htmx 2.0.",

If you’re an experienced developer looking to sharpen your architectural skills—particularly with regard to big data—this is one course you shouldn’t miss. Dive into the five main problems areas in distributed systems—storage, computation, messaging, timing, and consensus Understand key challenges that emerge in each of these areas as you move from single-processor to a distributed architecture Discover one or more common open-source products that address each problem area Tim Berglund is a full-stack generalist and passionate teacher who loves coding, presenting, and working with people. He’s the founder and principal software developer at August Technology Group, a technology consulting firm focused on the JVM. Tim is an international speaker and co-presenter of the bestselling McCullough and Berglund on Mastering Git (O’Reilly). About the O’Reilly Software Architecture Series Clearing a path from developer to architect and enriching that path once you arrive. Software architecture is a fast-moving, multidisciplinary subject where entire suites of \"best practices\" become obsolete practically overnight. No single path or curriculum exists, and different types of architecture—application, integration, enterprise—require different subject emphasis. Whether you’re at the outset of a career as an architect or in the midst of such a career, series editor Neal Ford has curated this collection of tools and guides for aspiring and seasoned architects alike.",

Objects also form the basis for many web technologies such as JavaScript, Python, and PHP.</p><p>It is of vital importance to learn the fundamental concepts of object orientation before starting to use object-oriented development environments. OOP promotes good design practices, code portability, and reuse–but it requires a shift in thinking to be fully understood. Programmers new to OOP should resist the temptation to jump directly into a particular programming language or a modeling language, and instead first take the time to learn what author Matt Weisfeld calls “the object-oriented thought process.”</p><p>Written by a developer for developers who want to improve their understanding of object-oriented technologies, <em>The Object-Oriented Thought Process</em> provides a solutions-oriented approach to object-oriented programming. Readers will learn to understand the proper uses of inheritance and composition, the difference between aggregation and association, and the important distinction between interfaces and implementations.</p><p>While programming technologies have been changing and evolving over the years, object-oriented concepts remain a constant–no matter what the platform. This revised edition focuses on the OOP technologies that have survived the past 20 years and remain at its core, with new and expanded coverage of design patterns, avoiding dependencies, and the SOLID principles to help make software designs understandable, flexible, and maintainable.</p><p>.</p></div></span>",

Objects also form the basis for many web technologies such as JavaScript, Python, and PHP. It is of vital importance to learn the fundamental concepts of object orientation before starting to use object-oriented development environments. OOP promotes good design practices, code portability, and reuse–but it requires a shift in thinking to be fully understood. Programmers new to OOP should resist the temptation to jump directly into a particular programming language or a modeling language, and instead first take the time to learn what author Matt Weisfeld calls “the object-oriented thought process.” Written by a developer for developers who want to improve their understanding of object-oriented technologies, The Object-Oriented Thought Process provides a solutions-oriented approach to object-oriented programming. Readers will learn to understand the proper uses of inheritance and composition, the difference between aggregation and association, and the important distinction between interfaces and implementations. While programming technologies have been changing and evolving over the years, object-oriented concepts remain a constant–no matter what the platform. This revised edition focuses on the OOP technologies that have survived the past 20 years and remain at its core, with new and expanded coverage of design patterns, avoiding dependencies, and the SOLID principles to help make software designs understandable, flexible, and maintainable. .",

This second edition covers Java 21, providing a clear guide to generics from their most common uses to the strangest corner cases, giving you everything you need to know to use and write generic APIs effectively. It covers the collections library thoroughly, so you'll always know how and when to use each collection for any given task. And it explains stream processing, so you'll know which model to use and how they interoperate to get the best out of the platform library. This indispensable guide covers: Fundamentals of generics: type parameters and generic methods Subtyping and wildcards Generics and reflection Design patterns for generics Sets, queues, lists, maps, and their implementations Concurrent programming and thread safety with collections Performance of different collection implementations Best practices for using and extending the Java collections framework Design philosophy and comparison with other collections libraries",

Illuminating both the core concepts and the hands-on programming techniques needed to succeed, this video course is ideal for developers, data scientists, analysts, and others—including those with no prior machine learning or statistics experience.</p><p>After introducing the essential building blocks of deep neural networks, such as artificial neurons and fully connected, convolutional, and recurrent layers, Magnus Ekman shows how to use them to build advanced architectures, including the Transformer. He describes how these concepts are used to build modern networks for computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), including large language models and multimodal networks. The code repository is located on <a href=\"https://github.com/NVDLI/LDL/\"><strong>github.com/NVDLI/LDL</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>About the Instructor:</strong></p><p><strong>Magnus Ekman</strong>, Ph.D., is a director of architecture at NVIDIA Corporation. His doctorate is in computer engineering, and he is the inventor of multiple patents. He was first exposed to artificial neural networks in the late nineties in his native country, Sweden. After some dabbling in evolutionary computation, he ended up focusing on computer architecture and relocated to Silicon Valley. He previously worked with processor design and R&amp;D at Sun Microsystems and Samsung Research America. In his current role at NVIDIA, he leads an engineering team working on CPU performance and power efficiency for chips used to run artificial intelligence (AI) applications.</p><p>As the deep learning (DL) and AI fields exploded in the past few years, fueled by NVIDIA's GPU technology and CUDA, Dr. Ekman found himself in the middle of a company expanding beyond computer graphics into becoming an AI powerhouse. As a part of that journey, he challenged himself to stay up-to-date with the most recent developments in the field. He partnered with the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) and wrote the book <em>Learning Deep Learning</em>, which was published by Pearson in 2021. He is thrilled to now follow up with this video, which is based on the book but also contains additional and updated content about the most recent development in large language models.</p><p><strong>Skill Level:</strong></p><ul><li>Beginner</li><li>Intermediate </li></ul><p><strong>Learn How To:</strong></p><ul><li>Apply core concepts of perceptrons, gradient-based learning, sigmoid neurons, and backpropagation</li><li>Utilize DL frameworks to make it easier to develop more complicated and useful neural networks</li><li>Utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform image classification and analysis</li><li>Apply recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to text and other variable-length sequences</li><li>Build a natural language translation application using sequence-to-sequence networks based on the transformer architecture</li><li>Use the transformer architecture for other natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and how to engineer prompts for large language models (LLM)</li><li>Combine image and text data and build multimodal networks, including an image captioning application</li></ul><p><strong>Who Should Take This Course:</strong></p><ul><li>Those who want to learn what deep learning is all about</li><li>Experienced programmers who want to take advantage of deep learning in applications</li></ul><p><strong>Course Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>Some programming knowledge, preferrably in Python, is needed to understand the programming examples</li><li>To fully understand the neural network learning algorithm (backpropagation), knowledge of calculus is required</li></ul><p><strong>Lesson Descriptions:</strong></p><p><strong>Lesson 1: Deep Learning Introduction</strong></p><p>Lesson 1 starts by introducing what deep learning is and a little bit of its history. It then turns to the prerequisites for the course.</p><p><strong>Lesson 2: Neural Network Fundamentals I</strong></p><p>Lesson 2 begins with the perceptron and its learning algorithm and shows how it works with a programming example. The perceptron is an artificial neuron. Artificial neurons are basic building blocks in deep learning. The perceptron has a bias term which is discussed further in the next section. Next comes a discussion of how to describe neural networks using matrices and vectors. That is followed by some limitations of the perceptron and how we can overcome them by connecting multiple perceptrons together into a neural network. In order to make such networks solve problems they need to be trained. The learning algorithm for a neural network is gradually introduced in the next three sections beginning with how to solve a learning problem with gradient descent. Parts of this is about computing gradients, and the lesson shows how that can be done using the chain rule of calculus. Next, the lesson puts it all together in the backpropagation algorithm, implementing the algorithm in a programming example. The lesson concludes with a discussion about the design parameter for artificial neurons that is known as an activation function.</p><p><strong>Lesson 3: Neural Network Fundamentals II</strong></p><p>Lesson 3, the second half of neural network fundamentals, starts by introducing data sets and the concept of generalization. Next comes an introduction to multiclass classification problems implemented with a programming example that classifies images of handwritten digits. The lesson describes what a deep learning framework is and how it can make it easier to experiment with deep learning. The digit classification example is then reimplemented using the deep learning framework, TensorFlow. And then the same example is implemented again but with the other major framework, PyTorch. Next comes discussion of problems related to saturated neurons and vanishing gradients and techniques to mitigate this. This is split up into two sections. First comes description of variations on the learning algorithm, and then the lesson turns to how to use some of the newly introduced techniques to improve the digit classification network, first in TensorFlow and then in PyTorch. The next section discusses how we use different output units and loss functions for different problem types. Discussion then ensues about something known as regularization techniques that help networks to generalize. The lesson concludes with another programming example, this time about regression, both in TensorFlow and in PyTorch.</p><p><strong>Lesson 4: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Image Classification</strong></p><p>Lesson 4 begins by introducing the CIFAR-10 data set. It then turns to describing what the convolutional layer looks like and how we can use it to build a convolutional network. Next, a convolutional neural network is used for image classification, both in TensorFlow and in PyTorch. The lesson also presents details of AlexNet, which was published in 2012 and started the DL revolution. It also describes VGGNet and GoogLeNet and, finally, ResNet. This is followed by a demonstration of how to use a pre-trained ResNet using TensorFlow and PyTorch. Finally, the video covers a little bit about how to make better use of your existing data and how to build more efficient convolutional neural networks.</p><p><strong>Lesson 5: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Time Series Prediction</strong></p><p>Lesson 5 starts by introducing some problem types that involve sequential data. It then introduces recurrent neural networks that can work on sequential data. Next it demonstrates how to apply such a network to a forecasting problem using TensorFlow and PyTorch. Recurrent neural networks are trained using a technique known as backpropagation through time. The lesson discusses some problems associated with that. It then describes how to address these problems using long short-term memory or LSTM. It introduces the two techniques, auto regression and beam search. They are often used to predict multiple steps into the future. Finally, the lesson demonstrates how to use an LSTM network with autoregression and beam search for text autocompletion with Tensor Flow and with PyTorch.</p><p><strong>Lesson 6: Neural Language Models and Word Embeddings</strong></p><p>Lesson 6 begins by describing what a language model is. This has to do with natural language processing, not just in the context of deep learning. The lesson describes a way of encoding words known as word embeddings. It then shows how to build a neural language model with word embeddings in TensorFlow and in PyTorch. This is the foundation for looking at large language models later in the course. The lesson then introduces word2vec, which is an algorithm to create word embeddings. Next comes a programming example demonstrating how to use pre-trained word embeddings. Finally, the lesson describes a technique known as wordpieces to be able to handle words that we haven’t seen before.</p><p><strong>Lesson 7: Encoder-Decoder Networks, Attention, Transformers, and Neural Machine Translation</strong></p><p>Lesson 7 introduces a network architecture known as encoder–decoder architecture and describes how we can use it for neural machine translation where we use a neural network to translate from French to English. This is then implemented with TensorFlow as well as with PyTorch. Magnus describes a concept known as attention that can be used to improve encoder–decoder networks. He then introduces the transformer architecture that is based on the attention mechanism. Finally, an improved version of the machine translation network is implemented by using the transformer, in both TensorFlow and PyTorch.</p><p><strong>Lesson 8: Large Language Models</strong></p><p>Lesson 8 is about large language models (LLMs) that make use of the transformer architecture. The lesson starts by describing BERT, which was an early large language model. It then describes details of GPT, which was another early large language model. The lesson then turns to the GPT family of models and how it gradually improved from GPT to GPT4. Next the lesson presents how to use a language model to build a chat bot. It shows how to improve the behavior of a pre-trained language model by using prompt tuning. Next the lesson discusses how LLMs can be improved by enabling them to retrieve data or use tools. The lesson also discusses open models a little bit and as well as data. Finally, the lesson ends with a demonstration of trying some different types of prompts with such an open model.</p><p><strong>Lesson 9: Multi-modal Networks and Image Captioning</strong></p><p>Lesson 9 is about building networks that work with two or more modalities. That is, it works with two or more types of data, for example, text and images. The lesson begins by introducing the concept of multi-modal learning and some associated challenges. Magnus then builds a simple multi-modal network, both in TensorFlow and in PyTorch. Next he describes a more advanced application to produce a textual description of an image, and again implements it with TensorFlow and with PyTorch. The lesson concludes with a description of how to add more modalities to large language models to build multi-modal large language models.</p><p><strong>Lesson 10: Multi-task Learning and Computer Vision Beyond Classification</strong></p><p>Lesson 10 begins by introducing the concept of multi-task learning. A simple multi-task learning example is then implemented with TensorFlow and with PyTorch. Magnus then describes a more advanced multi-task problem. It is a computer vision problem known as object detection. He shows how it can be solved using a network named R-CNN. The lesson continues by taking a look at improved networks known as fast and faster R-CNN. The lesson then introduces yet another computer vision problem known as segmentation and shows how it can be done using the deconvolution network and U-Net. Finally, the lesson ends with how to do instance segmentation using the Mask R-CNN network.</p><p><strong>Lesson 11: Applying Deep Learning</strong></p><p>In the final lesson, Magnus talks about some aspects to keep in mind as you start applying your newly gained skills. First he discusses ethical aspects related to artificial intelligence and working with data in general. It is important to think ahead and avoid unintentionally causing harm. He then provides some practical advice on how to approach the problem of tuning a network. Finally, the lesson ends by highlighting some areas that were not discussed in the lessons but that can be interesting for you to learn more about.</p><p><strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong></p><p>Pearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

                "description": "13+ Hours of Video Instruction A complete guide to deep learning for artificial intelligence Deep learning (DL) is a key component of today’s exciting advances in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Illuminating both the core concepts and the hands-on programming techniques needed to succeed, this video course is ideal for developers, data scientists, analysts, and others—including those with no prior machine learning or statistics experience. After introducing the essential building blocks of deep neural networks, such as artificial neurons and fully connected, convolutional, and recurrent layers, Magnus Ekman shows how to use them to build advanced architectures, including the Transformer. He describes how these concepts are used to build modern networks for computer vision and natural language processing (NLP), including large language models and multimodal networks. The code repository is located on github.com/NVDLI/LDL. About the Instructor: Magnus Ekman, Ph.D., is a director of architecture at NVIDIA Corporation. His doctorate is in computer engineering, and he is the inventor of multiple patents. He was first exposed to artificial neural networks in the late nineties in his native country, Sweden. After some dabbling in evolutionary computation, he ended up focusing on computer architecture and relocated to Silicon Valley. He previously worked with processor design and R&D at Sun Microsystems and Samsung Research America. In his current role at NVIDIA, he leads an engineering team working on CPU performance and power efficiency for chips used to run artificial intelligence (AI) applications. As the deep learning (DL) and AI fields exploded in the past few years, fueled by NVIDIA's GPU technology and CUDA, Dr. Ekman found himself in the middle of a company expanding beyond computer graphics into becoming an AI powerhouse. As a part of that journey, he challenged himself to stay up-to-date with the most recent developments in the field. He partnered with the NVIDIA Deep Learning Institute (DLI) and wrote the book Learning Deep Learning, which was published by Pearson in 2021. He is thrilled to now follow up with this video, which is based on the book but also contains additional and updated content about the most recent development in large language models. Skill Level: Beginner Intermediate Learn How To: Apply core concepts of perceptrons, gradient-based learning, sigmoid neurons, and backpropagation Utilize DL frameworks to make it easier to develop more complicated and useful neural networks Utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to perform image classification and analysis Apply recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) to text and other variable-length sequences Build a natural language translation application using sequence-to-sequence networks based on the transformer architecture Use the transformer architecture for other natural language processing (NLP) tasks, and how to engineer prompts for large language models (LLM) Combine image and text data and build multimodal networks, including an image captioning application Who Should Take This Course: Those who want to learn what deep learning is all about Experienced programmers who want to take advantage of deep learning in applications Course Requirements: Some programming knowledge, preferrably in Python, is needed to understand the programming examples To fully understand the neural network learning algorithm (backpropagation), knowledge of calculus is required Lesson Descriptions: Lesson 1: Deep Learning Introduction Lesson 1 starts by introducing what deep learning is and a little bit of its history. It then turns to the prerequisites for the course. Lesson 2: Neural Network Fundamentals I Lesson 2 begins with the perceptron and its learning algorithm and shows how it works with a programming example. The perceptron is an artificial neuron. Artificial neurons are basic building blocks in deep learning. The perceptron has a bias term which is discussed further in the next section. Next comes a discussion of how to describe neural networks using matrices and vectors. That is followed by some limitations of the perceptron and how we can overcome them by connecting multiple perceptrons together into a neural network. In order to make such networks solve problems they need to be trained. The learning algorithm for a neural network is gradually introduced in the next three sections beginning with how to solve a learning problem with gradient descent. Parts of this is about computing gradients, and the lesson shows how that can be done using the chain rule of calculus. Next, the lesson puts it all together in the backpropagation algorithm, implementing the algorithm in a programming example. The lesson concludes with a discussion about the design parameter for artificial neurons that is known as an activation function. Lesson 3: Neural Network Fundamentals II Lesson 3, the second half of neural network fundamentals, starts by introducing data sets and the concept of generalization. Next comes an introduction to multiclass classification problems implemented with a programming example that classifies images of handwritten digits. The lesson describes what a deep learning framework is and how it can make it easier to experiment with deep learning. The digit classification example is then reimplemented using the deep learning framework, TensorFlow. And then the same example is implemented again but with the other major framework, PyTorch. Next comes discussion of problems related to saturated neurons and vanishing gradients and techniques to mitigate this. This is split up into two sections. First comes description of variations on the learning algorithm, and then the lesson turns to how to use some of the newly introduced techniques to improve the digit classification network, first in TensorFlow and then in PyTorch. The next section discusses how we use different output units and loss functions for different problem types. Discussion then ensues about something known as regularization techniques that help networks to generalize. The lesson concludes with another programming example, this time about regression, both in TensorFlow and in PyTorch. Lesson 4: Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Image Classification Lesson 4 begins by introducing the CIFAR-10 data set. It then turns to describing what the convolutional layer looks like and how we can use it to build a convolutional network. Next, a convolutional neural network is used for image classification, both in TensorFlow and in PyTorch. The lesson also presents details of AlexNet, which was published in 2012 and started the DL revolution. It also describes VGGNet and GoogLeNet and, finally, ResNet. This is followed by a demonstration of how to use a pre-trained ResNet using TensorFlow and PyTorch. Finally, the video covers a little bit about how to make better use of your existing data and how to build more efficient convolutional neural networks. Lesson 5: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) and Time Series Prediction Lesson 5 starts by introducing some problem types that involve sequential data. It then introduces recurrent neural networks that can work on sequential data. Next it demonstrates how to apply such a network to a forecasting problem using TensorFlow and PyTorch. Recurrent neural networks are trained using a technique known as backpropagation through time. The lesson discusses some problems associated with that. It then describes how to address these problems using long short-term memory or LSTM. It introduces the two techniques, auto regression and beam search. They are often used to predict multiple steps into the future. Finally, the lesson demonstrates how to use an LSTM network with autoregression and beam search for text autocompletion with Tensor Flow and with PyTorch. Lesson 6: Neural Language Models and Word Embeddings Lesson 6 begins by describing what a language model is. This has to do with natural language processing, not just in the context of deep learning. The lesson describes a way of encoding words known as word embeddings. It then shows how to build a neural language model with word embeddings in TensorFlow and in PyTorch. This is the foundation for looking at large language models later in the course. The lesson then introduces word2vec, which is an algorithm to create word embeddings. Next comes a programming example demonstrating how to use pre-trained word embeddings. Finally, the lesson describes a technique known as wordpieces to be able to handle words that we haven’t seen before. Lesson 7: Encoder-Decoder Networks, Attention, Transformers, and Neural Machine Translation Lesson 7 introduces a network architecture known as encoder–decoder architecture and describes how we can use it for neural machine translation where we use a neural network to translate from French to English. This is then implemented with TensorFlow as well as with PyTorch. Magnus describes a concept known as attention that can be used to improve encoder–decoder networks. He then introduces the transformer architecture that is based on the attention mechanism. Finally, an improved version of the machine translation network is implemented by using the transformer, in both TensorFlow and PyTorch. Lesson 8: Large Language Models Lesson 8 is about large language models (LLMs) that make use of the transformer architecture. The lesson starts by describing BERT, which was an early large language model. It then describes details of GPT, which was another early large language model. The lesson then turns to the GPT family of models and how it gradually improved from GPT to GPT4. Next the lesson presents how to use a language model to build a chat bot. It shows how to improve the behavior of a pre-trained language model by using prompt tuning. Next the lesson discusses how LLMs can be improved by enabling them to retrieve data or use tools. The lesson also discusses open models a little bit and as well as data. Finally, the lesson ends with a demonstration of trying some different types of prompts with such an open model. Lesson 9: Multi-modal Networks and Image Captioning Lesson 9 is about building networks that work with two or more modalities. That is, it works with two or more types of data, for example, text and images. The lesson begins by introducing the concept of multi-modal learning and some associated challenges. Magnus then builds a simple multi-modal network, both in TensorFlow and in PyTorch. Next he describes a more advanced application to produce a textual description of an image, and again implements it with TensorFlow and with PyTorch. The lesson concludes with a description of how to add more modalities to large language models to build multi-modal large language models. Lesson 10: Multi-task Learning and Computer Vision Beyond Classification Lesson 10 begins by introducing the concept of multi-task learning. A simple multi-task learning example is then implemented with TensorFlow and with PyTorch. Magnus then describes a more advanced multi-task problem. It is a computer vision problem known as object detection. He shows how it can be solved using a network named R-CNN. The lesson continues by taking a look at improved networks known as fast and faster R-CNN. The lesson then introduces yet another computer vision problem known as segmentation and shows how it can be done using the deconvolution network and U-Net. Finally, the lesson ends with how to do instance segmentation using the Mask R-CNN network. Lesson 11: Applying Deep Learning In the final lesson, Magnus talks about some aspects to keep in mind as you start applying your newly gained skills. First he discusses ethical aspects related to artificial intelligence and working with data in general. It is important to think ahead and avoid unintentionally causing harm. He then provides some practical advice on how to approach the problem of tuning a network. Finally, the lesson ends by highlighting some areas that were not discussed in the lessons but that can be interesting for you to learn more about.

Purchase of the print or Kindle book includes a free eBook in PDF format. Key Features Get a comprehensive introduction to Rust for full-stack web development Explore the exciting evolution of Rust in recent years with WebAssembly, Axum, native TLS, and SurrealDB Build code in a scalable way with microservice and nanoservice design patterns Book Description Rust is no longer just for systems programming. This book will show you why this safe and performant language is a crucial up-and-coming option for developing web applications, and get you on your way to building fully functional Rust web apps. You don’t need any experience with Rust to get started, and this new edition also comes with a shallower learning curve. You’ll get hands-on with emerging Rust web frameworks including Actix, Axum, Rocket, and Hyper. You’ll look at injecting Rust into the frontend with WebAssembly and HTTPS configuration with NGINX. Later, you’ll move onto more advanced async topics, exploring TCP and framing, and implementing async systems. As you work through the book, you’ll build a to-do application with authentication using a microservice architecture that compiles into one Rust binary, including the embedding of a frontend JavaScript application in the same binary. The application will have end-to-end atomic testing and a deployment pipeline. By the end of this book, you’ll fully understand the significance of Rust for web development. You’ll also have the confidence to build robust, functional, and scalable Rust web applications from scratch. What you will learn Build scalable Rust web applications as monoliths or microservices Develop a deeper understanding of async Rust Get to grips with Rust language features like traits and the borrow checker Manage authentication and databases in Rust web apps Build app infrastructure on AWS using Terraform Learn how to package and deploy Rust servers Build unit tests and end-to-end tests for your Rust web apps with Python Who this book is for This book is for web developers who are looking to learn or adopt Rust to build safe and performant web applications. This includes developers familiar with languages such as Python, Ruby, and JavaScript. You don’t need any prior experience in Rust to start this book. However, you’ll need a solid understanding of web development principles, along with basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to get the most out of it.",

It starts with Java 8 fundamentals like lambdas, functional interfaces, and the Streams API, enabling a shift from imperative to declarative programming. Learners will set up their development environment and understand why Java 8 was a transformative release. As the course progresses, participants explore features from Java 9 to 21, including the Java Platform Module System (JPMS), local variable type inference (var), text blocks, enhanced switch expressions, records, sealed classes, and pattern matching. Object-oriented programming improvements and functional programming techniques are emphasized to help developers write concise, type-safe code. Practical modules cover parallel streams, the modern HTTP client, and date/time APIs for robust scheduling. The course culminates in a real-world CheckoutService application using sealed classes, a simple web server, and modern Java tooling. By the end, developers will have an up-to-date skill set to confidently build scalable, enterprise-grade Java applications.</p><p>To access the supplementary materials, scroll down to the 'Resources' section above the 'Course Outline' and click 'Supplemental Content.'

The video includes several much neglected yet essential techniques for page layout, including more advanced CSS techniques such as flexbox and CSS grid. It also covers the use of a static site generator to make websites that are easy to maintain and update. Finally, <em>Learn Enough HTML, CSS and Layout to Be Dangerous</em> shows you how to register and configure custom domains, including both custom URLs and custom email addresses. You can think of this tutorial as “a website in a box”: everything you need (and nothing you don’t) to design, build, and deploy modern, professional-grade websites.</p><p>In addition to teaching you specific skills, <em>Learn Enough HTML, CSS and Layout to Be Dangerous</em> also helps you develop technical sophistication—the seemingly magical ability to solve practically any technical problem. Technical sophistication includes concrete skills such as version control and HTML, as well as fuzzier skills like Googling the error message and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. Throughout the video you will have abundant opportunities to develop technical sophistication in the context of real-world examples. Focused exercises help you internalize what matters, without wasting time on details pros don’t care about. Soon, it’ll be like you were <em>born</em> knowing this stuff—and you’ll be suddenly, seriously <em>dangerous</em>.</p><p><strong>About the Instructors</strong></p><p><strong>Lee Donahoe</strong> is a Learn Enough cofounder, an entrepreneur, designer, and frontend developer.

In Lesson 1, you learn about the basic structure of an HTML page. You create a simple document with the elements every HTML page needs to enable a web browser to magically transform it from a text document with a bunch of strange symbols into a proper web page. Because Module 1 assumes no prior experience with HTML, you start off with writing only the absolute minimum of content that any HTML page must have to be valid. It is not going to look pretty yet, but this is foundational knowledge for everything you build in this tutorial. You also start the very good habit of tracking your code changes with the Git version control system and pushing those changes to GitHub for safekeeping. You even make your initial web page public on the Internet using GitHub Pages. In fact, every lesson in this entire tutorial is going to end by committing your changes and deploying the site to the live Web.</p><p><strong>Lesson 2: Filling in the Index Page</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 2, you take the very simple index page that you created in the previous lesson and start to fill in the sample page with content. You will use your index page to begin learning about the different HTML tags that contain and modify text. You start by learning about HTML tags that contain text such as headings or paragraphs. These tags can modify the appearance of the text they contain, but their main purpose is to determine the overall structure of the page. Later in Module 2, you will be putting boxes inside boxes, inside boxes, and then arranging them in all manner of ways on the page. Next, you learn about HTML tags that modify text, that is, which are mainly used to change the appearance of the content they contain. For example, you learn about tags that can format text as italic or bold without affecting everything around. You cap off the lesson by learning to add links to other pages, links to images, and even linked images.</p><p><strong>Lesson 3: More Pages, More Tags</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 3 you learn to add additional pages to your new website which will give you a chance to learn even more useful HTML tags. The first new page that you add will be a page with content about HTML tags. It is a very meta HTML page about HTML. Creating this new page gives you a chance to reinforce the preceding material as well as an opportunity to get experience using new HTML elements that do not add any distinct visual appearance. For example, tables and divs are general purpose boxes that can be used to organize content. You also wrap text in general purpose containers called spans, which later on will enable you to manipulate specific sections of text without affecting content around the span. You also add a second new page in the form of a lighthearted book report to give you a place to further practice organizing content. In the process of creating this page, you also learn how to make bulleted and numbered lists and set up basic site navigation so that you can easily click around between all of our pages. By the end of this lesson, you also start to see some of the limitations inherent in our purely hand-edited approach to building a website, which involves copying and pasting things like navigation menus from one page to another. Module 2 covers a solution to these limitations.</p><p><strong>Lesson 4: Inline Styling and CSS</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 4, we are going to dip our toes into learning about styling content. The real styling lessons will start in Module 2, but first we are first going to use a method of applying styles called inline styling, where the code for visual styling is applied directly to elements. We start by covering basic functions like changing the color or size of text. Then you learn how to float an image, so that text flows around it, and also to apply margins to create a boundary between the text and the image. Positioning and spacing images inside of text is a handy skill to have when creating a page that mixes text and images, which describes most Internet content. You also learn how to use margins and a new concept called padding to create a rudimentary page layout for your content. Lesson 4 wraps up by moving the inline styles into an internal style sheet on our HTML pages. Then, we move all of those styles off the pages and into a single external file that we can link to on each page. The result is to change a difficult to maintain HTML page with styling scattered everywhere to a cleaner HTML file and a separate style file. Such separate files are the most common way to organize cascading style sheets which are the main subject of Module 2.</p><p><strong>Lesson 5: Introduction to CSS</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 5, the first lesson of Module 2, you dive into Cascading Style Sheets, the design language of the Web. In this lesson, you take the first steps on the road to developing a much more complex website style using CSS. You start with a brief look at how CSS developed. And then you create a new clean slate page for you to start building on. This will be the index page for our new site. You explore what the “cascading” part of Cascading Style Sheets means and how the styles that you apply to one element spread down to other elements inside. You also learn different methods you can use to identify individual, or groups of elements, on the page using class and ID names. Lesson 5 approaches the topic of styling from a little more nuanced perspective and gives you a deeper understanding of how browsers render styles on web pages.</p><p><strong>Lesson 6: The Style of Style</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 6, you build on what you learned in the previous lesson to develop an understanding of the style of style. Another way to say that could also be how to make good choices in naming and structuring the various parts of our site. Along the way, you will also expand your understanding of what it is that browsers do care about. In Lesson 5, you styled objects using IDs and classes and by targeting types of elements in general, but this lesson delves into how different combinations of those affect what gets rendered by the browser.</p><p><strong>Lesson 7: CSS Values: Color and Sizing</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 7, we start looking at what can be done with styles, specifically how color works on web pages and how to specify sizes. Color and size are two kinds of CSS values, which can take a variety of different forms. Most CSS declarations are pretty self-explanatory. Not too many people are going to get confused by text align left, but there are quite a few that have extra complications, weird exceptions, or just odd ways of writing a value. So this lesson describes some of the how and the why behind these styles.</p><p><strong>Lesson 8: The Box Model</strong><br/>\nThe last half of Lesson 7 covered how to define sizes in CSS. In Lesson 8, you take those values and look at how to use them to understand one of the most important concepts in CSS, the box model. The CSS box model is the collective name for all the rules that determine how height, width, margin, padding, and borders are applied to elements and how those elements then interact with everything else on the page. This lesson will give you the tools that you need to learn a variety of ways to style elements, learn a couple of methods for getting boxes to sit next to each other, and use your new understanding of how the browser renders elements to create the foundation for the layout that will eventually be your full website.</p><p><strong>Lesson 9: Laying It All Out</strong><br/>\nLesson 9, you are going to really kick things into high gear with material you are unlikely to see in any other CSS tutorial—see how it fits into a system that lets you modularly structure an entire website. In this lesson you install and configure a static site generator called Jekyll. This enables you to chop up your HTML so that Jekyll can automatically recombine sections of it to render whatever is needed for a particular page. After Jekyll is installed and running you start the process of tearing apart your previous work to transform it into a set of templates and page layouts that can be easily reused and updated. In the process of restructuring your site, you also add more styling as a way to learn more complex aspects of CSS, and then you use those methods to help us refine our design, to make it more suitable for use as a personal or business website.</p><p><strong>Lesson 10: Page Template and Frontmatter</strong><br/>\nYou may have noticed that we finished Lesson 9 with a little problem. The default layout for our site also contains all of the content that should only go on our main index page. In Lesson 10, you tie up this loose end by learning how to insert content dynamically, thereby making your layout a truly reusable template. Ideally, you want that index page document to have only the content for the homepage, the actual structure of the site, like the header, footer, and so forth, should all be in separate files that you can put around arbitrary new content to create additional pages. This way you can include repeated content without having to copy and paste the same code onto every page. You use Jekyll page templates to accomplish this handy feat. And along the way you learn how to insert more content and templates, style the so-called hero section of the homepage, learn some more advanced selectors, and add pages in addition to the index page, including the beginning of an image gallery.</p><p><strong>Lesson 11: Specialty Page Layouts with Flexbox</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 11, you learn that CSS flexbox is a flexible box model for laying out content on the web. flexbox enables you to more finely control how child elements fill space inside of a container while also still being able to adapt to the content inside. You also take an opportunity in this lesson to give some additional design attention to other parts of the homepage, as well as look at how to apply more advanced flexbox features to create a three-column layout for the gallery that was introduced in the previous lesson.</p><p><strong>Lesson 12: Adding a Blog</strong><br/>\nHaving put your site in order using flexbox, in Lesson 12 you learn to make a second layout. You use this new layout as the base for adding a blog to your sample website, but you could use the same concept for any sort of content such as documentation or product information. Adding a blog to your site will give you a chance to apply most of the CSS covered so far like font styling, margins, padding, selectors, and of course flexbox. Jekyll is a blog-aware framework that comes pre-configured to understand how to process and read content to make blog-like sites. Unlike some other content platforms you might be familiar with though, there’s no content-management system. You’re not going to be able to type text into a box and click a button to make something italic or bold. Instead, you’re going to write content as individual text files that use a lightweight markup format called Markdown and then Jekyll will take those files and automatically turn them into HTML. It is no-frills, but it is an endlessly customizable system that lets you create content using the text editor of your choice. It does not leave you at the mercy of a third-party service that could shut down at any time. And by putting the project under version control with Git, you also have a complete archive of the site’s history. Oh, and the cherry on top, with GitHub pages, you have free hosting.</p><p><strong>Lesson 13: Mobile Media Queries</strong><br/>\nIn Lesson 13, you add a few layers of polish that will help make your site look professional. The most important change will be styling that lets your site look good on both desktop and mobile devices, a practice known as responsive design. To make our site responsive to different screen sizes, you use bits of CSS magic called media queries that can be set to apply certain styles to the page only when the screen is a certain width or some other attribute. At the end of the lesson, you also get your site menu to work nicely on mobile devices. Up until now, the menu only drops down when a mouse cursor hovers over it, and now you are going to make it respond to screen taps as well. The best part is that you are going to do it all with just HTML and CSS instead of inviting more complicated technologies like JavaScript to the party.</p><p><strong>Lesson 14: Adding More Little Touches</strong><br/>\nIn this lesson you learn to make your site look even more professional and complete by adding some of those little details and final touches that really tie a site together. You add support for custom fonts loaded from a third-party service then apply the new fonts to different content on the page. You also integrate a vector-based icon library for user interface elements on the site. You add one of those fun little icons that you see on a tab in a desktop browser, and you also add title and meta information to our pages, so they’re better indexed by search engines.</p><p><strong>Lesson 15: CSS Grid</strong><br/>\nLesson 15 is a largely self-contained introduction to an incredibly powerful modern CSS technique known as CSS grid. Using two skeleton pages, we’ll first cover using grid to (unsurprisingly) make a simple grid of content. Then we’ll tweak our perspective a little on how the browser understands CSS grid and use it to create two different layouts: one with the grid on the outside of the entire page, and one where we place a grid inside each main section of a page to provide a structure that we can snap child elements to. By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of how you can use CSS grid for a variety of different site layouts.</p><p><strong>About Pearson Video Training</strong></p><p>Pearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

                "description": "11 Hours of Video Instruction In Learn Enough HTML, CSS and Layout to Be Dangerous: An Introduction to Modern Website Creation and Templating Systems, renowned instructors Lee Donahoe and Michael Hartl teach the concepts, skills, and approaches you need to be make modern websites deploy them to the World Wide Web. Overview Learn Enough HTML, CSS and Layout to Be Dangerous teaches you how to make modern websites using Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). The video includes several much neglected yet essential techniques for page layout, including more advanced CSS techniques such as flexbox and CSS grid. It also covers the use of a static site generator to make websites that are easy to maintain and update. Finally, Learn Enough HTML, CSS and Layout to Be Dangerous shows you how to register and configure custom domains, including both custom URLs and custom email addresses. You can think of this tutorial as “a website in a box”: everything you need (and nothing you don’t) to design, build, and deploy modern, professional-grade websites. In addition to teaching you specific skills, Learn Enough HTML, CSS and Layout to Be Dangerous also helps you develop technical sophistication—the seemingly magical ability to solve practically any technical problem. Technical sophistication includes concrete skills such as version control and HTML, as well as fuzzier skills like Googling the error message and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing. Throughout the video you will have abundant opportunities to develop technical sophistication in the context of real-world examples. Focused exercises help you internalize what matters, without wasting time on details pros don’t care about. Soon, it’ll be like you were born knowing this stuff—and you’ll be suddenly, seriously dangerous.

Skill Level Beginner to intermediate Learn How To Use basic HTML tags Create an index page Use tables, divs, spans, and lists Use CSS to style text and format pages Use CSS to create color and size things Use a static site generator to put the same elements on every page Create flexible page layouts using flexbox Create a professional-grade blog application Register and configure custom domains Who Should Take This Course Those who want to make and deploy modern websites Aspiring front-end designers and developers Course Requirements Knowledge of the Unix command line, a text editor, and version control with Git (as covered, for example, in Learn Enough Developer Tools to Be Dangerous) Lesson Descriptions Lesson 1: Basic HTML Underneath every website, no matter how simple or complex, you’ll find HTML. In Lesson 1, you learn about the basic structure of an HTML page. You create a simple document with the elements every HTML page needs to enable a web browser to magically transform it from a text document with a bunch of strange symbols into a proper web page. Because Module 1 assumes no prior experience with HTML, you start off with writing only the absolute minimum of content that any HTML page must have to be valid. It is not going to look pretty yet, but this is foundational knowledge for everything you build in this tutorial. You also start the very good habit of tracking your code changes with the Git version control system and pushing those changes to GitHub for safekeeping. You even make your initial web page public on the Internet using GitHub Pages. In fact, every lesson in this entire tutorial is going to end by committing your changes and deploying the site to the live Web. Lesson 2: Filling in the Index Page In Lesson 2, you take the very simple index page that you created in the previous lesson and start to fill in the sample page with content. You will use your index page to begin learning about the different HTML tags that contain and modify text. You start by learning about HTML tags that contain text such as headings or paragraphs. These tags can modify the appearance of the text they contain, but their main purpose is to determine the overall structure of the page. Later in Module 2, you will be putting boxes inside boxes, inside boxes, and then arranging them in all manner of ways on the page. Next, you learn about HTML tags that modify text, that is, which are mainly used to change the appearance of the content they contain. For example, you learn about tags that can format text as italic or bold without affecting everything around. You cap off the lesson by learning to add links to other pages, links to images, and even linked images. Lesson 3: More Pages, More Tags In Lesson 3 you learn to add additional pages to your new website which will give you a chance to learn even more useful HTML tags. The first new page that you add will be a page with content about HTML tags. It is a very meta HTML page about HTML. Creating this new page gives you a chance to reinforce the preceding material as well as an opportunity to get experience using new HTML elements that do not add any distinct visual appearance. For example, tables and divs are general purpose boxes that can be used to organize content. You also wrap text in general purpose containers called spans, which later on will enable you to manipulate specific sections of text without affecting content around the span. You also add a second new page in the form of a lighthearted book report to give you a place to further practice organizing content. In the process of creating this page, you also learn how to make bulleted and numbered lists and set up basic site navigation so that you can easily click around between all of our pages. By the end of this lesson, you also start to see some of the limitations inherent in our purely hand-edited approach to building a website, which involves copying and pasting things like navigation menus from one page to another. Module 2 covers a solution to these limitations. Lesson 4: Inline Styling and CSS In Lesson 4, we are going to dip our toes into learning about styling content. The real styling lessons will start in Module 2, but first we are first going to use a method of applying styles called inline styling, where the code for visual styling is applied directly to elements. We start by covering basic functions like changing the color or size of text. Then you learn how to float an image, so that text flows around it, and also to apply margins to create a boundary between the text and the image. Positioning and spacing images inside of text is a handy skill to have when creating a page that mixes text and images, which describes most Internet content. You also learn how to use margins and a new concept called padding to create a rudimentary page layout for your content. Lesson 4 wraps up by moving the inline styles into an internal style sheet on our HTML pages. Then, we move all of those styles off the pages and into a single external file that we can link to on each page. The result is to change a difficult to maintain HTML page with styling scattered everywhere to a cleaner HTML file and a separate style file. Such separate files are the most common way to organize cascading style sheets which are the main subject of Module 2. Lesson 5: Introduction to CSS In Lesson 5, the first lesson of Module 2, you dive into Cascading Style Sheets, the design language of the Web. In this lesson, you take the first steps on the road to developing a much more complex website style using CSS. You start with a brief look at how CSS developed. And then you create a new clean slate page for you to start building on. This will be the index page for our new site. You explore what the “cascading” part of Cascading Style Sheets means and how the styles that you apply to one element spread down to other elements inside. You also learn different methods you can use to identify individual, or groups of elements, on the page using class and ID names. Lesson 5 approaches the topic of styling from a little more nuanced perspective and gives you a deeper understanding of how browsers render styles on web pages. Lesson 6: The Style of Style In Lesson 6, you build on what you learned in the previous lesson to develop an understanding of the style of style. Another way to say that could also be how to make good choices in naming and structuring the various parts of our site. Along the way, you will also expand your understanding of what it is that browsers do care about. In Lesson 5, you styled objects using IDs and classes and by targeting types of elements in general, but this lesson delves into how different combinations of those affect what gets rendered by the browser. Lesson 7: CSS Values: Color and Sizing In Lesson 7, we start looking at what can be done with styles, specifically how color works on web pages and how to specify sizes. Color and size are two kinds of CSS values, which can take a variety of different forms. Most CSS declarations are pretty self-explanatory. Not too many people are going to get confused by text align left, but there are quite a few that have extra complications, weird exceptions, or just odd ways of writing a value. So this lesson describes some of the how and the why behind these styles. Lesson 8: The Box Model The last half of Lesson 7 covered how to define sizes in CSS. In Lesson 8, you take those values and look at how to use them to understand one of the most important concepts in CSS, the box model. The CSS box model is the collective name for all the rules that determine how height, width, margin, padding, and borders are applied to elements and how those elements then interact with everything else on the page. This lesson will give you the tools that you need to learn a variety of ways to style elements, learn a couple of methods for getting boxes to sit next to each other, and use your new understanding of how the browser renders elements to create the foundation for the layout that will eventually be your full website. Lesson 9: Laying It All Out Lesson 9, you are going to really kick things into high gear with material you are unlikely to see in any other CSS tutorial—see how it fits into a system that lets you modularly structure an entire website. In this lesson you install and configure a static site generator called Jekyll. This enables you to chop up your HTML so that Jekyll can automatically recombine sections of it to render whatever is needed for a particular page. After Jekyll is installed and running you start the process of tearing apart your previous work to transform it into a set of templates and page layouts that can be easily reused and updated. In the process of restructuring your site, you also add more styling as a way to learn more complex aspects of CSS, and then you use those methods to help us refine our design, to make it more suitable for use as a personal or business website. Lesson 10: Page Template and Frontmatter You may have noticed that we finished Lesson 9 with a little problem. The default layout for our site also contains all of the content that should only go on our main index page. In Lesson 10, you tie up this loose end by learning how to insert content dynamically, thereby making your layout a truly reusable template. Ideally, you want that index page document to have only the content for the homepage, the actual structure of the site, like the header, footer, and so forth, should all be in separate files that you can put around arbitrary new content to create additional pages. This way you can include repeated content without having to copy and paste the same code onto every page. You use Jekyll page templates to accomplish this handy feat. And along the way you learn how to insert more content and templates, style the so-called hero section of the homepage, learn some more advanced selectors, and add pages in addition to the index page, including the beginning of an image gallery. Lesson 11: Specialty Page Layouts with Flexbox In Lesson 11, you learn that CSS flexbox is a flexible box model for laying out content on the web. flexbox enables you to more finely control how child elements fill space inside of a container while also still being able to adapt to the content inside. You also take an opportunity in this lesson to give some additional design attention to other parts of the homepage, as well as look at how to apply more advanced flexbox features to create a three-column layout for the gallery that was introduced in the previous lesson. Lesson 12: Adding a Blog Having put your site in order using flexbox, in Lesson 12 you learn to make a second layout. You use this new layout as the base for adding a blog to your sample website, but you could use the same concept for any sort of content such as documentation or product information. Adding a blog to your site will give you a chance to apply most of the CSS covered so far like font styling, margins, padding, selectors, and of course flexbox. Jekyll is a blog-aware framework that comes pre-configured to understand how to process and read content to make blog-like sites. Unlike some other content platforms you might be familiar with though, there’s no content-management system. You’re not going to be able to type text into a box and click a button to make something italic or bold. Instead, you’re going to write content as individual text files that use a lightweight markup format called Markdown and then Jekyll will take those files and automatically turn them into HTML. It is no-frills, but it is an endlessly customizable system that lets you create content using the text editor of your choice. It does not leave you at the mercy of a third-party service that could shut down at any time. And by putting the project under version control with Git, you also have a complete archive of the site’s history. Oh, and the cherry on top, with GitHub pages, you have free hosting. Lesson 13: Mobile Media Queries In Lesson 13, you add a few layers of polish that will help make your site look professional. The most important change will be styling that lets your site look good on both desktop and mobile devices, a practice known as responsive design. To make our site responsive to different screen sizes, you use bits of CSS magic called media queries that can be set to apply certain styles to the page only when the screen is a certain width or some other attribute. At the end of the lesson, you also get your site menu to work nicely on mobile devices. Up until now, the menu only drops down when a mouse cursor hovers over it, and now you are going to make it respond to screen taps as well. The best part is that you are going to do it all with just HTML and CSS instead of inviting more complicated technologies like JavaScript to the party. Lesson 14: Adding More Little Touches In this lesson you learn to make your site look even more professional and complete by adding some of those little details and final touches that really tie a site together. You add support for custom fonts loaded from a third-party service then apply the new fonts to different content on the page. You also integrate a vector-based icon library for user interface elements on the site. You add one of those fun little icons that you see on a tab in a desktop browser, and you also add title and meta information to our pages, so they’re better indexed by search engines. Lesson 15: CSS Grid Lesson 15 is a largely self-contained introduction to an incredibly powerful modern CSS technique known as CSS grid. Using two skeleton pages, we’ll first cover using grid to (unsurprisingly) make a simple grid of content. Then we’ll tweak our perspective a little on how the browser understands CSS grid and use it to create two different layouts: one with the grid on the outside of the entire page, and one where we place a grid inside each main section of a page to provide a structure that we can snap child elements to. By the end, you’ll have a solid understanding of how you can use CSS grid for a variety of different site layouts.

Overview: Learn the ins and outs of Linux Internals and discover what makes Linux the most powerful operating system Get under the hood and understand how Linux really works Perform in-depth practical investigations of key Linux functionalities Linux Under the Hood offers an extensive exploration of how Linux functions, allowing you to fully harness its capabilities. Familiarizing yourself with Linux internals will allow you to surpass mere commands and gain valuable insights to optimize your use of Linux. The first module dives into a deeper understanding of Linux architecture; you will learn about the inner workings of key Linux components like the kernel, systemd, and the Linux boot procedure. The following module will focus on storage and filesystems, encompassing local devices as well as cloud and datacenter storage solutions. Next, we will cover core components, including memory, processes, and the intricacies of command execution. Finally, we will explore Linux's evolution into a container-based platform. Each lesson concludes with a real-world scenario, where Sander demonstrates the practical implementation of various features explained in the lesson videos. Sign up for live training classes by Sander van Vugt: Linux Under the Hood (Updated) If you believe your knowledge of the Linux operating system is limited, you can start with Sander’s Linux Fundamentals, 2 nd edition video course. About the Instructor: Sander van Vugt has many years of experience working with, writing about, and teaching Linux and Open-Source topics. He is the author of the best-selling Red Hat RHCSA and RHCE Cert Guides as well as a number of other titles on Kubernetes (including CKAD and CKA), Ansible, Containers, Bash, Microservices, and more. Sander also works as a Linux and DevOps instructor, teaching onsite and online classes for customers around the world. Skill Level: Intermediate to advanced Course requirement: Learners are expected to have basic working knowledge of the Linux operating system. Learners should prepare one virtual or physical machine with any Linux distribution; hardware specs are not important. To make it easy to follow along with the instructor, it is recommended (but not required) to install either the latest version of Ubuntu LTS (either workstation or server edition) or the latest CentOS Stream or equivalent. Who Should Take This Course: The target audience for this course consists of people that have used Linux for a while and who want to know what it really is doing. The typical primary audience consists of system administrators. The secondary audience consists of operating system students and others who want to know how Linux works.

It's available on almost every OS, and if you master the techniques in this book, you'll never need another text editor. In more than 120 Vim tips, you'll quickly learn the editor's core functionality and tackle your trickiest editing and writing tasks. This beloved bestseller has been revised and updated to Vim 7.4 and includes three brand-new tips and five fully revised tips. A highly configurable, cross-platform text editor, Vim is a serious tool for programmers, web developers, and sysadmins who want to raise their game. No other text editor comes close to Vim for speed and efficiency; it runs on almost every system imaginable and supports most coding and markup languages. Learn how to edit text the \"Vim way\": complete a series of repetitive changes with The Dot Formula using one keystroke to strike the target, followed by one keystroke to execute the change. Automate complex tasks by recording your keystrokes as a macro. Discover the \"very magic\" switch that makes Vim's regular expression syntax more like Perl's. Build complex patterns by iterating on your search history. Search inside multiple files, then run Vim's substitute command on the result set for a project-wide search and replace. All without installing a single plugin! Three new tips explain how to run multiple ex commands as a batch, autocomplete sequences of words, and operate on a complete search match. Practical Vim, Second Edition will show you new ways to work with Vim 7.4 more efficiently, whether you're a beginner or an intermediate Vim user. All this, without having to touch the mouse.

Sinan is a former lecturer of data science at Johns Hopkins University and the author of multiple textbooks on data science and machine learning. Additionally, he is the founder of the recently acquired Kylie.ai, an enterprise-grade conversational AI platform with RPA capabilities. Sinan holds a master’s degree in pure mathematics from Johns Hopkins University and is based in San Francisco, California.</p><p><strong>Learn How To:</strong></p><ul><li>Develop an understanding of different types of LLMs and how they fit into RAG</li><li>Build a RAG application using a vector database and multiple embedders</li><li>Test different generators like GPT-4o, Claude, Command-R, and more</li><li>Build your own API for running RAG</li><li>Demonstrate a chat application based on your RAG work</li><li>Utilize advance dtechniques like GraphRAG</li></ul><p><strong>Who Should Take This Course:</strong></p><p>Developers, data scientists, and engineers who are interested in improving the output of their LLMs</p><p><strong>Course Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li>Python 3 proficiency with some experience working in interactive Python environments including Notebooks (Jupyter/Google Colab/Kaggle Kernels)</li><li>Comfortable using the Pandas library and Python </li><li>Understanding of ML/deep learning fundamentals including train/test splits, loss/cost functions, and gradient descent</li></ul><p><strong>Lesson Descriptions: </strong></p><p>Lesson 1. Introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation.</p><p>Lesson 1 presents the core components of a retrieval augmented generation system and how they work together to create a seamless user experience using real-time and dynamic data.</p><p>Lesson 2. Building the Foundations</p><p>Lesson 2 covers different LLMs and which part of the family tree they come from. Whether they’re auto-encoding models, the fast readers of the bunch, or auto-regressive models, the ones that know how to write, each one will have a place in your RAG system.</p><p>Lesson 3. Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques</p><p>Asking a question of an LLM is easy, but getting it to solve a task reliably, consistently, and with a decent level of accuracy can be a challenge. Lesson 3 focuses on the core components of a good prompt, uncovering how a language model thinks about tasks and how we can ask it to do these tasks and iterate on our prompts quickly. By the end of the lesson, you will know how to get the most consistent and reliable results from nearly any generative AI.</p><p>Lesson 4. Developing a RAG System</p><p>This lesson has you putting together all of the components you’ve been seeing so far into a single application that we can test end-to-end to get an initial gut check for how well the chatbot works. It also reveals just how little we actually know so far about how the system will work at scale, opening up the doors for LLM evaluations in later sections. This lesson also introduces the world of open-source embedders and generators and how they stack up against their closed-source cousins.</p><p>Lesson 5. Evaluating and Testing RAG Systems</p><p>In this lesson, the notion of gut checks is left behind for actually quantifying what it means for a retriever to be accurate, precise, and able to recall relevant documents while judging generators on their ability to be safe and conversational and ignore noise. You will also see different methods for evaluating the generators of the system to keep them honest and helpful.</p><p>Lesson 6. Expanding and Applying RAG Systems</p><p>The final lesson explores the cutting edge of retrieval augmented generation by fine-tuning open-source embedders, looking at how re-ranking systems can bolster your retrieval component, and showing how knowledge graphs can augment even the simplest RAG applications with dynamic, real-time, and transparent structured data by building a GraphRAG system.</p><p><strong>About Pearson Video Training:</strong></p><p>Pearson publishes expert-led video tutorials covering a wide selection of technology topics designed to teach you the skills you need to succeed.

                "description": "4+ Hours of Video Instruction Start building, evaluating, and iterating on retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems today! Overview: Practical Retrieval Augmented Generation shows you how to improve existing large language models by giving them the ability to access additional information that was not part of their original training data. About the Instructor: Sinan Ozdemir is the founder and CTO of LoopGenius where he uses state-of-the-art AI to help people create and run their businesses. Sinan is a former lecturer of data science at Johns Hopkins University and the author of multiple textbooks on data science and machine learning. Additionally, he is the founder of the recently acquired Kylie.ai, an enterprise-grade conversational AI platform with RPA capabilities. Sinan holds a master’s degree in pure mathematics from Johns Hopkins University and is based in San Francisco, California. Learn How To: Develop an understanding of different types of LLMs and how they fit into RAG Build a RAG application using a vector database and multiple embedders Test different generators like GPT-4o, Claude, Command-R, and more Build your own API for running RAG Demonstrate a chat application based on your RAG work Utilize advance dtechniques like GraphRAG Who Should Take This Course: Developers, data scientists, and engineers who are interested in improving the output of their LLMs Course Requirements: Python 3 proficiency with some experience working in interactive Python environments including Notebooks (Jupyter/Google Colab/Kaggle Kernels) Comfortable using the Pandas library and Python Understanding of ML/deep learning fundamentals including train/test splits, loss/cost functions, and gradient descent Lesson Descriptions: Lesson 1. Introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation. Lesson 1 presents the core components of a retrieval augmented generation system and how they work together to create a seamless user experience using real-time and dynamic data. Lesson 2. Building the Foundations Lesson 2 covers different LLMs and which part of the family tree they come from. Whether they’re auto-encoding models, the fast readers of the bunch, or auto-regressive models, the ones that know how to write, each one will have a place in your RAG system. Lesson 3. Advanced Prompt Engineering Techniques Asking a question of an LLM is easy, but getting it to solve a task reliably, consistently, and with a decent level of accuracy can be a challenge. Lesson 3 focuses on the core components of a good prompt, uncovering how a language model thinks about tasks and how we can ask it to do these tasks and iterate on our prompts quickly. By the end of the lesson, you will know how to get the most consistent and reliable results from nearly any generative AI. Lesson 4. Developing a RAG System This lesson has you putting together all of the components you’ve been seeing so far into a single application that we can test end-to-end to get an initial gut check for how well the chatbot works. It also reveals just how little we actually know so far about how the system will work at scale, opening up the doors for LLM evaluations in later sections. This lesson also introduces the world of open-source embedders and generators and how they stack up against their closed-source cousins. Lesson 5. Evaluating and Testing RAG Systems In this lesson, the notion of gut checks is left behind for actually quantifying what it means for a retriever to be accurate, precise, and able to recall relevant documents while judging generators on their ability to be safe and conversational and ignore noise. You will also see different methods for evaluating the generators of the system to keep them honest and helpful. Lesson 6. Expanding and Applying RAG Systems The final lesson explores the cutting edge of retrieval augmented generation by fine-tuning open-source embedders, looking at how re-ranking systems can bolster your retrieval component, and showing how knowledge graphs can augment even the simplest RAG applications with dynamic, real-time, and transparent structured data by building a GraphRAG system.

These lectures are intended for:</p><ul><li>Any student (from high school to graduate level) having a good introduction to programming, with an interest in majoring in any science or engineering discipline (including computer science).</li><li>Anyone using a computer to address large problems that require an understanding of efficient algorithms.</li><li>Anyone interested in preparing for a career in industry involving software or computer applications.</li></ul><p><strong>Course Requirements</strong></p><ul><li>Basic familiarity with Java</li><li>Some background in programming</li></ul><p><strong>Table of Contents</strong></p><p>Lecture 1: Union-Find. We illustrate our basic approach to developing and analyzing algorithms by considering the dynamic connectivity problem. We introduce the union-find data type and consider several implementations (quick find, quick union, weighted quick union, and weighted quick union with path compression). Finally, we apply the union-find data type to the percolation problem from physical chemistry.</p><p><strong>Lecture 2:</strong> Analysis of Algorithms. The basis of our approach for analyzing the performance of algorithms is the scientific method. We begin by performing computational experiments to measure the running times of our programs. We use these measurements to develop hypotheses about performance. Next, we create mathematical models to explain their behavior. Finally, we consider analyzing the memory usage of our Java programs.</p><p><strong>Lecture 3:</strong> Stacks and Queues. We consider two fundamental data types for storing collections of objects: the stack and the queue. We implement each using either a singly-linked list or a resizing array. We introduce two advanced Java features generics and iterators that simplify client code. Finally, we consider various applications of stacks and queues ranging from parsing arithmetic expressions to simulating queueing systems.</p><p><strong>Lecture 4:</strong> Elementary Sorts. We introduce the sorting problem and Java's Comparable interface. We study two elementary sorting methods (selection sort andinsertion sort) and a variation of one of them (shellsort). We also consider two algorithms for uniformly shuffling an array. We conclude with an application of sorting to computing the convex hull via the Graham scan algorithm.</p><p><strong>Lecture 5:</strong> Mergesort. We study the mergesort algorithm and show that it guarantees to sort any array of N items with at most NlgN compares. We also consider a nonrecursive, bottom-up version. We prove that any compare-based sorting algorithm must make at least NlgN compares in the worst case. We discuss using different orderings for the objects that we are sorting and the related concept of stability.</p><p><strong>Lecture 6:</strong> Quicksort. We introduce and implement the randomized quicksort algorithm and analyze its performance. We also consider randomized quickselect, a quicksort variant which finds the kth smallest item in linear time. Finally, consider 3-way quicksort, a variant of quicksort that works especially well in the presence of duplicate keys.</p><p><strong>Lecture 7:</strong> Priority Queues. We introduce the priority queue data type and an efficient implementation using the binary heap data structure. This implementation also leads to an efficient sorting algorithm known as heapsort. We conclude with an applications of priority queues where we simulate the motion of N particles subject to the laws of elastic collision.</p><p><strong>Lecture 8:</strong> Elementary Symbol Tables. We define an API for symbol tables (also known as associative arrays) and describe two elementary implementations using a sorted array (binary search) and an unordered list (sequential search). When the keys are Comparable, we define an extended API that includes the additional methods min, max floor, ceiling, rank, and select. To develop an efficient implementation of this API, we study the binary search tree data structure and analyze its performance</p><p><strong>Lecture 9:</strong> Balanced Search Trees. In this lecture, our goal is to develop a symbol table with guaranteed logarithmic performance for search and insert (and many other operations). We begin with 2-3 trees, which are easy to analyze but hard to implement. Next, we consider red-black binary search trees, which we view as a novel way to implement 2-3 trees as binary search trees. Finally, we introduce B-trees, a generalization of 2-3 trees that are widely used to implement file systems.</p><p><strong>Lecture 10:</strong> Geometric Applications of BSTs. We start with 1d and 2d range searching, where the goal is to find all points in a given 1d or 2d interval. To accomplish this, we consider kd-trees, a natural generalization of BSTs when the keys are points in the plane (or higher dimensions). We also consider intersection problems, where the goal is to find all intersections among a set of line segments or rectangles.</p><p><strong>Lecture 11:</strong> Hash Tables. We begin by describing the desirable properties of hash functions and how to implement them in Java, including a fundamental tenet known as the uniform hashing assumption that underlies the potential success of a hashing application. Then, we consider two strategies for implementing hash tables separate chaining and linear probing. Both strategies yield constant-time performance for search and insert under the uniform hashing assumption. We conclude with applications of symbol tables including sets, dictionary clients, indexing clients, and sparse vectors.</p><p><strong>Lecture 12:</strong> Undirected Graphs. We define an undirected graph API and consider the adjacency-matrix and adjacency-lists representations. We introduce two classic algorithms for searching a graph depth-first search and breadth-first search. We also consider the problem of computing connected components and conclude with related problems and applications.</p><p><strong>Lecture 13:</strong> Directed Graphs. In this lecture we study directed graphs. We begin with depth-first search and breadth-first search in digraphs and describe applications ranging from garbage collection to web crawling. Next, we introduce a depth-first search based algorithm for computing the topological order of an acyclic digraph. Finally, we implement the Kosaraju-Sharir algorithm for computing the strong components of a digraph.</p><p><strong>Lecture 14:</strong> Minimum Spanning Trees. In this lecture we study the minimum spanning tree problem. We begin by considering a generic greedy algorithm for the problem. Next, we consider and implement two classic algorithms for the problem Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm. We conclude with some applications and open problems.</p><p><strong>Lecture 15:</strong> Shortest Paths. In this lecture we study shortest-paths problems. We begin by analyzing some basic properties of shortest paths and a generic algorithm for the problem. We introduce and analyze Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest-paths problems with nonnegative weights. Next, we consider an even faster algorithm for DAGs, which works even if the weights are negative. We conclude with the Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm for edge-weighted digraphs with no negative cycles. We also consider applications ranging from content-aware fill to arbitrage.</p><p><strong>Lecture 16:</strong> Maximum Flow and Minimum Cut. In this lecture we introduce the maximum flow and minimum cut problems. We begin with the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. To analyze its correctness, we establish the maxflow-mincut theorem. Next, we consider an efficient implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, using the shortest augmenting path rule. Finally, we consider applications, including bipartite matching and baseball elimination.</p><p><strong>Lecture 17:</strong> Radix Sorts. In this lecture we consider specialized sorting algorithms for strings and related objects. </p><p>We begin with a subroutine to sort integers in a small range. We then consider two classic radix sorting algorithms LSD and MSD radix sorts. Next, we consider an especially efficient variant, which is a hybrid of MSD radix sort and quicksort known as 3-way radix quicksort. We conclude with suffix sorting and related applications.</p><p><strong>Lecture 18:</strong> Tries. In this lecture we consider specialized algorithms for symbol tables with string keys. Our goal is a data structure that is as fast as hashing and even more flexible than binary search trees. We begin with multiway tries; next we consider ternary search tries. Finally, we consider character-based operations, including prefix match and longest prefix, and related applications.</p><p><strong>Lecture 19:</strong> Substring Search. In this lecture we consider algorithms for searching for a substring in a piece of text. We begin with a brute-force algorithm, whose running time is quadratic in the worst case. Next, we consider the ingenious Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm whose running time is guaranteed to be linear in the worst case. Then, we introduce the Boyer-Moore algorithm, whose running time is sublinear on typical inputs. Finally, we consider the Rabin-Karp fingerprint algorithm, which uses hashing in a clever way to solve the substring search and related problems.</p><p><strong>Lecture 20:</strong> Regular Expressions. A regular expression is a method for specifying a set of strings. Our topic for this lecture is the famous grep algorithm that determines whether a given text contains any substring from the set. We examine an efficient implementation that makes use of our digraph reachability implementation from Lectures 1 and 2.</p><p><strong>Lecture 21:</strong> Data Compression. We study and implement several classic data compression schemes, including run-length coding, Huffman compression, and LZW compression. We develop efficient implementations from first principles using a Java library for manipulating binary data that we developed for this purpose, based on priority queue and symbol table implementations from earlier lectures.</p><p><strong>Lecture 22:</strong> Reductions. In this lecture our goal is to develop ways to classify problems according to their computational requirements. We introduce the concept of reduction as a technique for studying the relationship among problems. People use reductions to design algorithms, establish lower bounds, and classify problems in terms of their computational requirements.</p><p><strong>Lecture 23:</strong> Linear Programming. The quintessential problem-solving model is known as linear programming, and the simplex method for solving it is one of the most widely used algorithms. In this lecture, we give an overview of this central topic in operations research and describe its relationship to algorithms that we have considered.</p><p><strong>Lecture 24:</strong> Intractability. Is there a universal problem-solving model to which all problems that we would like to solve reduce and for which we know an efficient algorithm? You may be surprised to learn that we do not know the answer to this question. In this lecture we introduce the complexity classes P, NP, and NP-complete; pose the famous P = NP question; and consider implications in the context of algorithms that we have treated in this course.</p></span></span>",

The algorithms described in these lectures represent a body of knowledge developed of the last 50 years that has become indispensable. These lectures present: Implementations of useful algorithms Detailed information on performance characteristics Examples of clients and applications The early lectures cover our fundamental approach to studying algorithms, including data types for stacks, queues, and other low-level abstractions. Then we cover these major topics: Sorting algorithms, highlighting the classic Quicksort and Mergesort algorithms. Searching algorithms, including search methods based on balanced search trees and hashing. String-processing algorithms, from tries and substring search to regular expression search and data compression. Graph algorithms, starting with graph search, shortest paths, and minimum spanning trees, and working up to maximum flow/minimum cut and applications. Reductions, linear programming, and intractability. Who Should Take This Course The study of algorithms and data structures is fundamental to any computer-science curriculum, but it is not just for programmers and computer science students. These lectures are intended for: Any student (from high school to graduate level) having a good introduction to programming, with an interest in majoring in any science or engineering discipline (including computer science). Anyone using a computer to address large problems that require an understanding of efficient algorithms. Anyone interested in preparing for a career in industry involving software or computer applications. Course Requirements Basic familiarity with Java Some background in programming Table of Contents Lecture 1: Union-Find. We illustrate our basic approach to developing and analyzing algorithms by considering the dynamic connectivity problem. We introduce the union-find data type and consider several implementations (quick find, quick union, weighted quick union, and weighted quick union with path compression). Finally, we apply the union-find data type to the percolation problem from physical chemistry. Lecture 2: Analysis of Algorithms. The basis of our approach for analyzing the performance of algorithms is the scientific method. We begin by performing computational experiments to measure the running times of our programs. We use these measurements to develop hypotheses about performance. Next, we create mathematical models to explain their behavior. Finally, we consider analyzing the memory usage of our Java programs. Lecture 3: Stacks and Queues. We consider two fundamental data types for storing collections of objects: the stack and the queue. We implement each using either a singly-linked list or a resizing array. We introduce two advanced Java features generics and iterators that simplify client code. Finally, we consider various applications of stacks and queues ranging from parsing arithmetic expressions to simulating queueing systems. Lecture 4: Elementary Sorts. We introduce the sorting problem and Java's Comparable interface. We study two elementary sorting methods (selection sort andinsertion sort) and a variation of one of them (shellsort). We also consider two algorithms for uniformly shuffling an array. We conclude with an application of sorting to computing the convex hull via the Graham scan algorithm. Lecture 5: Mergesort. We study the mergesort algorithm and show that it guarantees to sort any array of N items with at most NlgN compares. We also consider a nonrecursive, bottom-up version. We prove that any compare-based sorting algorithm must make at least NlgN compares in the worst case. We discuss using different orderings for the objects that we are sorting and the related concept of stability. Lecture 6: Quicksort. We introduce and implement the randomized quicksort algorithm and analyze its performance. We also consider randomized quickselect, a quicksort variant which finds the kth smallest item in linear time. Finally, consider 3-way quicksort, a variant of quicksort that works especially well in the presence of duplicate keys. Lecture 7: Priority Queues. We introduce the priority queue data type and an efficient implementation using the binary heap data structure. This implementation also leads to an efficient sorting algorithm known as heapsort. We conclude with an applications of priority queues where we simulate the motion of N particles subject to the laws of elastic collision. Lecture 8: Elementary Symbol Tables. We define an API for symbol tables (also known as associative arrays) and describe two elementary implementations using a sorted array (binary search) and an unordered list (sequential search). When the keys are Comparable, we define an extended API that includes the additional methods min, max floor, ceiling, rank, and select. To develop an efficient implementation of this API, we study the binary search tree data structure and analyze its performance Lecture 9: Balanced Search Trees. In this lecture, our goal is to develop a symbol table with guaranteed logarithmic performance for search and insert (and many other operations). We begin with 2-3 trees, which are easy to analyze but hard to implement. Next, we consider red-black binary search trees, which we view as a novel way to implement 2-3 trees as binary search trees. Finally, we introduce B-trees, a generalization of 2-3 trees that are widely used to implement file systems. Lecture 10: Geometric Applications of BSTs. We start with 1d and 2d range searching, where the goal is to find all points in a given 1d or 2d interval. To accomplish this, we consider kd-trees, a natural generalization of BSTs when the keys are points in the plane (or higher dimensions). We also consider intersection problems, where the goal is to find all intersections among a set of line segments or rectangles. Lecture 11: Hash Tables. We begin by describing the desirable properties of hash functions and how to implement them in Java, including a fundamental tenet known as the uniform hashing assumption that underlies the potential success of a hashing application. Then, we consider two strategies for implementing hash tables separate chaining and linear probing. Both strategies yield constant-time performance for search and insert under the uniform hashing assumption. We conclude with applications of symbol tables including sets, dictionary clients, indexing clients, and sparse vectors. Lecture 12: Undirected Graphs. We define an undirected graph API and consider the adjacency-matrix and adjacency-lists representations. We introduce two classic algorithms for searching a graph depth-first search and breadth-first search. We also consider the problem of computing connected components and conclude with related problems and applications. Lecture 13: Directed Graphs. In this lecture we study directed graphs. We begin with depth-first search and breadth-first search in digraphs and describe applications ranging from garbage collection to web crawling. Next, we introduce a depth-first search based algorithm for computing the topological order of an acyclic digraph. Finally, we implement the Kosaraju-Sharir algorithm for computing the strong components of a digraph. Lecture 14: Minimum Spanning Trees. In this lecture we study the minimum spanning tree problem. We begin by considering a generic greedy algorithm for the problem. Next, we consider and implement two classic algorithms for the problem Kruskal's algorithm and Prim's algorithm. We conclude with some applications and open problems. Lecture 15: Shortest Paths. In this lecture we study shortest-paths problems. We begin by analyzing some basic properties of shortest paths and a generic algorithm for the problem. We introduce and analyze Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest-paths problems with nonnegative weights. Next, we consider an even faster algorithm for DAGs, which works even if the weights are negative. We conclude with the Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm for edge-weighted digraphs with no negative cycles. We also consider applications ranging from content-aware fill to arbitrage. Lecture 16: Maximum Flow and Minimum Cut. In this lecture we introduce the maximum flow and minimum cut problems. We begin with the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm. To analyze its correctness, we establish the maxflow-mincut theorem. Next, we consider an efficient implementation of the Ford-Fulkerson algorithm, using the shortest augmenting path rule. Finally, we consider applications, including bipartite matching and baseball elimination. Lecture 17: Radix Sorts. In this lecture we consider specialized sorting algorithms for strings and related objects. We begin with a subroutine to sort integers in a small range. We then consider two classic radix sorting algorithms LSD and MSD radix sorts. Next, we consider an especially efficient variant, which is a hybrid of MSD radix sort and quicksort known as 3-way radix quicksort. We conclude with suffix sorting and related applications. Lecture 18: Tries. In this lecture we consider specialized algorithms for symbol tables with string keys. Our goal is a data structure that is as fast as hashing and even more flexible than binary search trees. We begin with multiway tries; next we consider ternary search tries. Finally, we consider character-based operations, including prefix match and longest prefix, and related applications. Lecture 19: Substring Search. In this lecture we consider algorithms for searching for a substring in a piece of text. We begin with a brute-force algorithm, whose running time is quadratic in the worst case. Next, we consider the ingenious Knuth-Morris-Pratt algorithm whose running time is guaranteed to be linear in the worst case. Then, we introduce the Boyer-Moore algorithm, whose running time is sublinear on typical inputs. Finally, we consider the Rabin-Karp fingerprint algorithm, which uses hashing in a clever way to solve the substring search and related problems. Lecture 20: Regular Expressions. A regular expression is a method for specifying a set of strings. Our topic for this lecture is the famous grep algorithm that determines whether a given text contains any substring from the set. We examine an efficient implementation that makes use of our digraph reachability implementation from Lectures 1 and 2. Lecture 21: Data Compression. We study and implement several classic data compression schemes, including run-length coding, Huffman compression, and LZW compression. We develop efficient implementations from first principles using a Java library for manipulating binary data that we developed for this purpose, based on priority queue and symbol table implementations from earlier lectures. Lecture 22: Reductions. In this lecture our goal is to develop ways to classify problems according to their computational requirements. We introduce the concept of reduction as a technique for studying the relationship among problems. People use reductions to design algorithms, establish lower bounds, and classify problems in terms of their computational requirements. Lecture 23: Linear Programming. The quintessential problem-solving model is known as linear programming, and the simplex method for solving it is one of the most widely used algorithms. In this lecture, we give an overview of this central topic in operations research and describe its relationship to algorithms that we have considered. Lecture 24: Intractability. Is there a universal problem-solving model to which all problems that we would like to solve reduce and for which we know an efficient algorithm? You may be surprised to learn that we do not know the answer to this question. In this lecture we introduce the complexity classes P, NP, and NP-complete; pose the famous P = NP question; and consider implications in the context of algorithms that we have treated in this course.",

Ron Veen and David Vlijmincx will provide a clear and simple understanding of virtual threads and why they are superior to the threads that Java developers have used in the last 25 years, outlining problems facing current thread models. Next, you’ll uncover how virtual threads work behind the scenes, blocked, mounting, and unmounting is in the context of virtual threads. Then, you’ll explore the different ways of creating virtual threads, such as the constructor, builder method and new executor services. Finally, you’ll learn the pitfalls of virtual threads and when to watch out for limited scalability and how to detect it. After viewing this video, you’ll understand the fundamentals of virtual threads and when to apply this knowledge to code immediately. What You Will Learn: • Learn what virtual threads are and how they work behind the scenes • Understand the problems virtual threads solve • Discover the pitfalls of virtual threads and when they won’t work",
